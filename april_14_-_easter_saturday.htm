<p>Since we would drive to the airport on Easter Sunday, we did Easter a day
early.&nbsp; We had full Easter baskets for the girls, complete with gigantic
chocolate bunnies, several gifts apiece, and too much Easter candy.&nbsp; We did
not have proper Easter baskets, so we temporarily co-opted the 2 trash baskets
(after washing each).&nbsp; Doug made sure to get the girls all the kinds of
Easter candy the he likes.&nbsp; The chocolate malted eggs all actually went to
him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jody hid all the gifts and eggs inside the trailer while I recorded the
location of each on a crude map -- having a lost egg go south and stink up the
trailer did not sound fun.&nbsp; It took the girls almost an hour to find
everything, even with serious help; they are not the best lookers.&nbsp; Perhaps
that is a skill that comes with age and practice.</p>
<p>After all the goodies were found, opened, appreciated and shown off, Jody
made us a miraculous Easter Brunch of vegetarian Eggs benedict, including
avocado and hollandaise.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Next up: laundry (again).&nbsp; Joya needed to have everything clean for her
trip, and we all had other dirties tucked away, so when all the toting was done
we had 5 full loads and several hours of work.&nbsp; When that was done, Joya
laid out all of her clothes and gear for her trip in preparation for packing,
which involved all of us to some degree and took another few hours.</p>
<i>[new stuff]</i>
<p>That evening, the campground was having a &quot;Flashlight Easter Egg
Hunt&quot;.&nbsp; This sounded fun to watch, so we wandered over.&nbsp; We had
had several conversations with the owner of the RV park earlier.&nbsp; Jody and
I spent most of the 'hunt' talking (actually listening) to him -- he was loud
and garrulous, and had taken a bit of a shine to us, I guess.&nbsp; During the
conversation we quizzed him about RV park ownership, mostly out of
curiosity.&nbsp; He gave us the sordid background of this park -- it was rife
with drugs, guns and prostitution -- and explained that that all changed when he
took over and kicked all the riff-raff out.&nbsp; He had a public pool at the
park that got heavy use during summer.&nbsp; It came out during the conversation
that he kept things safe by the simply expedient of keeping all people of color
out of the park.&nbsp; He said &quot;I hope y'all are not pro-Black or pro-Hispanic&quot;.&nbsp;
I was a bit dumbstruck, and rather than respond to his question, asked if he
meant that he excluded people from this park without knowing them at all -- just
based on color.&nbsp; He waffled a bit, and said that in his experience, a
car-full of Black or Hispanic boys between the ages of 17 and 25 were a major
source of trouble, and that those were who he excluded.&nbsp; Families of color
were OK.&nbsp; Jody said that a car-full of ANY race males between those ages
were likely to be problematic,&nbsp; but he said nothing to that.&nbsp; The
whole exchange left us nonplussed.&nbsp; A real live racist, who was also a
seemingly nice normal guy.&nbsp; We felt bad giving him our money.&nbsp; We
probably won't go back there.</p>
<p>As we had to get up at 6:30, we took and early bedtime.</p>
