<p>Across the Chesapeake Bay to the East lies Maryland's &quot;Eastern
Shore&quot;.&nbsp; It is a beautiful, wild wooded and unspoiled piece of country
only 2 hours from Washington D.C.&nbsp; We were headed to the Southeastern
shore, near Maryland's border with Virginia, bound for Assateague Island.
  </p>
  <p>As you can see below, Doug is wearing some sort of parka-type clothing and
  he is being threatened by a policeman and his canine assistant.&nbsp; Contrary
  to what you are probably thinking (that Doug got caught AGAIN with illegal
  fireworks) he is preparing to be dog chow for a demonstration at our new
  campground.&nbsp; The long story is that we made reservations at a public
  campground with two parts, one on either side of a river.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
  the side we were originally on did NOT have the pool but did have all the
  pets.&nbsp; Swimming in the river was not allowed.&nbsp; At least we think
  that's what we were told.&nbsp; It was a little difficult to hear over the
  barking.&nbsp; We managed to beg a spot across the river, the side with the
  pool and without the dogs, with one exception (see below).
  </p>
<img border="0" src="images/3/144-4480_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640">
<p>Doug is looking a lot like a chew toy.&nbsp; He is still smiling but only to
mask the fact that his gonads had temporarily disappeared.&nbsp; The very nice
officer kindly suggested that Doug could jump up and down a few times and cough
and they would return to normal position.</p>
<p>The demo was really interesting, even with Doug in the padded suit.&nbsp; The
dog was a beautiful (and strong) Polish shepherd that lived with the officer all
the time.&nbsp; We learned how they train dogs for tracking and &quot;bite&quot;
work.&nbsp; Doug did get a small bruise on his arm even through the suit.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/144-4482_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>The kids found a small downhill sloping road near our campsite that they made
good use of.&nbsp; The pictures didn't turn out very well due to the fading
daylight and the multiple miles per hour of the scooter riders.&nbsp; But you
can kind of get the idea.&nbsp; It had the added bonus of keeping the mosquitoes
from being able to lite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/144-4493_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>We were camped at&nbsp; Pocomoke River State Park (we love State Parks!)
.&nbsp; Kenny discovered that frogs were everywhere; he spent quite a lot of his
time one evening chasing, catching and observing them.&nbsp; He found the frog
in the picture below -- so tiny!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4620_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The next day we drove to Assateague Island.&nbsp; This is a beautiful island
owned entirely by the state and federal governments so there is no
development.&nbsp; It is famous for the wild ponies that live there and continue
to roam freely.&nbsp; The headless creature below is our nephew, Kenny,
astounding us with yet another amazing feat.&nbsp; He was actually breathing (a
bit) under the sand.&nbsp; Remember: he is a professional, kids -- do not try
this at home.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/145-4510_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Joya just can't stop taking pictures of Jordan and we just can't resist
putting them on the website.</p>
<p>Jordan developed a reaction to cold water which manifested itself for the
first time in the ocean on this day.&nbsp; She got out of the water after
swimming and had little raised, itchy welts all over her body.&nbsp; We at first
thought she had gotten into a jellyfish cluster, but it proved to be a hive
reaction to cold water.&nbsp; The water was about 70� and felt really good, but
it was cold enough to cause hives in Jordan.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/145-4522a_IMG.JPG" width="476" height="483"></p>
<p>The yin and yang of beach goers.&nbsp; I can't get enough shade and Doug is
happiest in the full sun.&nbsp; Doug's hat posture came from the wind, and it is
fetching, don't you think?</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/145-4546a_IMG.JPG" width="618" height="358"></p>
<p>The Mod Squad.&nbsp; (Doug got to be Link).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/145-4554a1_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>I caught Joya after she got dusted by a wave. The surf wasn't big, but the
sea floor got shallow really quickly so if you caught a wave and rode it in, you
got rubbed right into the sand.&nbsp; The water was nice.&nbsp; There was no
seaweed or tar and the water was clean and warm(ish).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/145-4571a_IMG.JPG" width="527" height="219"></p>
<p>Ah, the ponies saunter by.&nbsp; It was obvious they had the run of the
place.&nbsp; They were coming by for their afternoon scrounge for food, slowly
working their way up the beach.&nbsp; People quickly hid their lunches and
watched the parade.&nbsp; Kenny, however, had other ideas...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/145-4583_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Kenny walked along with the horses, at a respectful distance for quite
awhile.&nbsp; Then he plunked down in the sand to watch them.&nbsp; One of the
ponies came right up to him and nuzzled his head.&nbsp; These are gentle ponies,
but they are still wild.&nbsp; He held really still and it eventually meandered
on.&nbsp; Fortunately, Kenny did not have anything too yummy stuck in his hair,
or we might have had to have a difficult conversation with his parents...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4604a_IMG.JPG" width="550" height="427"></p>
<p>The ponies were all over.&nbsp; It was such a beautiful, perfect beach day.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4614a_IMG.JPG" width="650" height="460"></p>
<p>We decided that our perfect pristine day at the beach should be balanced out
with an over-the-top beach city board walk amusement park kind of
experience.&nbsp; So we headed north to Ocean City, about 10 miles away from
Assateague.&nbsp; We parked the car and went directly to Jimi's Crab Shack,
where we feasted on crab sandwiches and fries and lemonades.&nbsp; Then we
cruised out on to the board walk.&nbsp; We thought the Ferris wheel would be fun
(if a bit scary for Kenny and me).&nbsp; Well, as you can see by the picture
from the top, it was pretty darn high.&nbsp; Kenny opened his eyes, briefly, at
the top, and I started making plans (and noises) about getting off.&nbsp; It was
WAY too high for me.&nbsp; So we did one revolution, got off (at my earnest
request) and the rest of our party continued on the ride.&nbsp; I was happy to
be safely on the ground and watch.&nbsp; My stomach did a wee flip-flop when I
saw that Doug and Jordan had changed places while at the top of the Ferris
wheel.&nbsp; For those of you with sharp eyes, that's me and Kenny to the left
of the &quot;Crossbow Shoot&quot;.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4616_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Doug took Jordan and Kenny to the Ripley's Believe It or Not Odditorium.&nbsp;
It was Kenny's first time and Doug and Jordan's second (Key West, in
March).&nbsp; They all have different things in them and they are fascinating in
their absolutely bizarre way.&nbsp; In the meantime, Joya was hunting for a
tattoo pattern she liked.&nbsp; Both girls got henna tattoos on their
legs.&nbsp; Henna tattoos last for two to three weeks and are THE choice for
those folks who need permission from their parents for the other kind.&nbsp; And
these don't hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4617_IMG.JPG" align="left" width="297" height="391">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/3/146-4618_IMG.JPG" width="295" height="391"></p>
<p>We capped the night off with Polish water ices with vanilla cream.&nbsp; What
a great day!</p>
