  <p>We drove the short distance from the Colorado Springs area to greater
  Denver.&nbsp; We chose to camp in Golden, which was central to the people with
  whom we wanted to visit.
  </p>
<p>Our dear friend Lanis called the night we arrived.&nbsp; It turns out that
she needed to inspect an Airstream trailer that she was buying, but the
inspection needed to be done by the 15th or so.&nbsp; With the airports closed,
flying was not an opting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we were within a long stones' throw
of Montrose, we offered to check it out for her, since we were going to Glenwood
Springs anyway.&nbsp; Montrose was only another 2 1/2 hours drive away, so we
departed early for our big road trip through the Rockies, as we had 290 miles to
drive, each way.</p>
We took I-70 straight West, through the Rockies.&nbsp; The drive was marvelous
-- easy, 65 miles per hour, and amazing country to look at when I was not
concentrating on driving.&nbsp; We drove to Grand Junction -- only 14 hours from
Santa Barbara -- and then headed South to Montrose.&nbsp; Mr. Virgil Turner was
a very nice, accommodating man.&nbsp; He operated all of the systems and
features of the trailer for us, on request.&nbsp; And as he had stated,
everything worked well.&nbsp; It really was a lovely trailer.&nbsp; We reported
this to Lanis via cell phone, after which she and Mr. Turner cinched the deal;
Lanis now owned a 1968 Airstream, and we had the bill of sale to prove it.&nbsp;
<p>We drove back into Delta, and lunched at an A&amp;W we had seen.&nbsp; We
love A&amp;Ws.&nbsp; There appear to be far too few of them these McDays.</p>
<p>We took Mr. Turner's advice, and drove back along highway 133, which follows
the Crystal River through some breathtaking country.&nbsp; See for
yourself.&nbsp; The aspens and other trees were &quot;turning&quot;, so we
caught some of the color.&nbsp; This was taken just above the little town of
Marble, so named I believe because a train derailed there in the 1800s, dumping
its cargo of marble all about.&nbsp; It was cheaper to leave it than clean it
up, so it is still there today.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/167-6746a_IMG.JPG" width="581" height="440"></p>
<p>The 133 rejoined the I-70 at Glenwood Springs.&nbsp; Jody heard about
Glenwood Springs from a postcard she received from our friend Joanie Bernard
(Ellen and Cora's mother).&nbsp;&nbsp; Joanie and her girls had visited there
once on one of their cross-country drives, and had apparently raved about
it.&nbsp; With just cause, as it turns out.&nbsp; There is a gigantic
hot-springs fed public pool there.&nbsp; Established during the early 1900s, it
has been a popular stop for decades.&nbsp; We arrived around 5 PM, armed with
our bathing suits and towels, not really knowing what to expect.&nbsp; It was
fabulous.&nbsp; The water was very sulfurous, which I really enjoyed.&nbsp; The
'hot tub' was as big as an Olympic pool, and was kept at 104.&nbsp; The swimming
pool was 94.&nbsp; It was grand -- we swam for 2 or 3 hours, until hunger drove
us from the waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the 'hot tub'.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/167-6747_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>And this is the swimming pool.&nbsp; I am at a loss to describe to you its
size -- it was gigantic.&nbsp; It took minutes to stroll past.&nbsp; Hundreds
could bath in it, and not be particularly aware of each other.&nbsp; As you can
see, all ages bathed there -- babies, adults, teens, and the elderly.&nbsp; It
was a community event, coming to the baths.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/167-6751_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>After we got back into our street clothes, we went in search of food, which
we found at a brew-pub across the street.&nbsp; They were packed, so it was
nearly 9 when we were finished eating.&nbsp; After all the driving, then
swimming, then eating, then drinking 1 beer, we were way too relaxed to drive
the 2 1/2 hours back down the mountain to Denver.&nbsp; The brew-pub was
operated by the Hotel Denver, next door.&nbsp; I inquired about a room for us,
and had in mind that if it was $85 or less, we would take it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
course, I said nothing of this to anyone at the time.&nbsp; The front desk clerk
clicked on his computer, and said he had a room we could have for $84 -- so it
was fated.</p>
<p>We checked in, and then walked back across the street for an après-diner
swim.&nbsp; At 9, the pools had even more bathers than they did at 5, with
everyone chatting in small groups. It was like a big community-wide party.&nbsp;
We loved it.</p>
<p>After the swim, we hit the hotel room and watched some TV.&nbsp; We all
reported that we slept exceedingly well that nights.</p>
