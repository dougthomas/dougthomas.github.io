<p align="center"><font face="Century Gothic" color="#003399">Ok, I am just
going to blab now. I'm really sorry to those (few) of you who check the site
often, hoping in vein for new info, because I just can't keep up. My Dad does a
pretty recent update of what we have been doing day-by-day, so please go to
those pages if you want that. In the beginning of the trip I was doing that too,
but now...I'm not so organized.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Century Gothic" color="#3366FF">I am looking
forward to New York, although my Mom and Dad aren't too keen on all the &quot;hubbub&quot;
of the city. That's what I like. We will be attending a wedding there, and my
cousin Kevin is graduating from High School around that same time. We are also
meeting my Aunt, Uncle and other cousin Kenny, as well as my Grandma and
Grandpa.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Century Gothic" color="#006666">I have been
playing around with the pictures I take recently, and It's really fun! Dad gets kinda
mad when I take about 100 pics, but he gets over it. Here are some:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Century Gothic" color="#3366FF">Jordan, in the
car.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/1/136-3655a_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"><font face="Century Gothic" color="#006666">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Century Gothic" color="#330066">As you probably
noticed, Jordan is my primary target, since she is the only one who doesn't mind
having someone in her face, saying &quot;hold still! Smile!&quot; all the
time.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/1/137-3727a_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Century Gothic" color="#000066">Jordan in the
State Park, where we had our car fixed.&nbsp; There were no showers, and so we
had a little home-grown hair washing day.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/1/137-3711a_IMG.JPG" width="511" height="424"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">I'm home! I&nbsp;had a <u><b>fabulous</b></u>
time at EnCompass. I missed everyone, honestly, I did, but I had a really
incredible experience. There were approximately 20 participants on the course,
some of which I knew from last years course, home schooling events or home,
others I was meeting for the first time.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">A couple of my good
friends from Santa Barbara were there; Hannah and Shelly. Hannah went on the
course last year, and Shelly was coming for the first time. Tessany is also my
good friend, and she had been staying in Santa Barbara with my other good
friend, Kai. So they had all been seeing each other just a few weeks before. It
was great to see all of them. I&nbsp;also reunited with the people I had spent a
week with last year, but didn't get to know as well.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">I don't think I will go
into too much detail about the course itself, if you would like to know about
something specifically, please ask me. Email: <a href="mailto:travelgirlUS@hotmail.com">travelgirlUS@hotmail.com</a>
, IM me: pooka358 and call me: (805) 689-6277!!!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">As you probably know, we
built a sweat lodge. We built it by hand, on the EnCompass land (they have
around 180 acres). We made it rammed-earth style, which means that it was part
earth, and part cement. The floor was mostly earth, not as much cement, and the
walls are mostly cement, not as much earth. We did a rebar frame to begin with,
and then did wire mesh encasing the insulation. Then plaster. It's supposed to
have three layers of plaster, but in order for us to be able to take a sweat in
the lodge before the course was over, we had to leave it in stage 2. The third
coat will have to be done by other people, another time.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">We also went down the Eel
river for the last week. We paddled down 25 miles of it, in Canoes. Two people
to a Canoe, and we switched partners around. It was a total blast!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">Here are some pics. I only
got one roll. In other words, I took more than this, I just don't have them
available to me at this time.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">Here is the list of participants:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099"><u>Guys:</u></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#CC0099">Bodhi, Nathan, Artec,

before, I don't have all of my pics, and all the ones of the sweat lodge
completed are with the &quot;Lost Rolls&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma">And my favorite one of all: My Mom took
this one, and I changed it some, and I <i>love</i> it! It really captures the

made regular visits to, during our stay on Ocracoke.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#00CC00">I'm back from EnCompass!:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#6699CC">Ok, here is some news
about after EnCompass:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#6699CC">We were in Ocracoke the
first week back from EnCompass. Tessany was with us, and we were both feeling
sort of sluggish, and we were (are) missing everyone from camp TONS! So Mom and
Dad had sort of counted on having relaxed, napping kind of days, which was very
nice for all of us.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#6699CC">We rode around the island
on our rented bikes, and laid on the beach, took naps in the hammock, and ate extraordinary
food! Quite nice. It was all very relaxing.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#6699CC">For Mother's Day we just
hung out at our campground in Raleigh, NC. Here are some pics from May
13th:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Tahoma" color="#6699CC">Mom, reading Jordan's
Mother's Day card to her.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#FF66CC">I am gone from April 15th
through May 5th, on an EnCompass course, and so will not be updating my page
during that time. EnCompass is an Outdoor education course. We will be building
a sweat-lodge from scratch for the first 2 weeks, and for the last week we will
be on the Eel River in California. My Home State! I am <i>really </i>looking
forward to it! But that's not the point. Well, I guess that's it! Enjoy!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#0099FF">We went to see
part of the Masters golf tournament, as you probably read on &quot;born
again&quot;. Well, it was pretty cool, even though I would definitely not call
myself a &quot;golf person&quot;. My mom and I went for about an hour, and saw
Tiger Woods, and Vijay Singh, as well as others who's names aren't jumping out at
me... But it was all very exciting. We got the tickets from Dave Caddell (below)
who got the &quot;badges&quot; from a neighbor. He kindly gave them to us for
the day, and we split up the time between us.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#9933FF">We just (late March) left the

<p align="center">&nbsp;<font size="4" face="Verdana" color="#FF66CC">And here
is Chelsea! We got the pics from Ralph, Chelsea's Dad, using his digital video
camera. We had a 5 day visit with Chelsea, and we stayed right outside of a small
town near Atlanta, GA, called Helen. My Mom's description of it was &quot;Kitchy&quot;.
My Dad used the word &quot;dysneyesque&quot; and I think the town was a combo.
It was a &quot;wannabe&quot; German town, and <i>very</i> tourist oriented, to
say the least. We walked there! 3 miles. One way. But that was after a 10 mile
hike (both ways) the day before. I firmly stated that I would run away if they
were going to make us go on another hike, after 17 miles of walking!</font></p>

Me, I would go all the way, but, that's me. We went to Disneyworld, Epcot, MGM, and Animal
Kingdom, which are all around 10 min. away from our campground. We got
&quot;park-hopper&quot; passes, to see all four parks in four days. The first
day, we went to the &quot;Magical Kingdom&quot;, and went on all of the usual
rides: Space Mountain; Thunder Mountain; Pirates of the Caribbean; Autopia car
racing, etc.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Lucida Console" size="4" color="#00CC00">Here
is a pic of me on the race track, wishing it were a real car! I <u><b><i>LOVE</i></b></u>
to drive, and Mom and Dad have only let me drive the van once. One night in
Epcot though, we were leaving the parking lot at around 10:30PM (the park closes
at 9:00PM) and it was almost empty, and I <i><b><u>SO</u></b></i> wanted to
drive around for a little while, but Dad wouldn't give in. &quot;Too many
cars,&quot; he said. Oh well. I drove the jeep around at the Sisks too, that was
a blast!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#00CC00" face="Lucida Console">Do you
see the smears in the upper right hand corner? That is just a hint of what has
taken over our camera. Don't be surprised if we don't have any pics for a while.
We are going to be sending the camera in for repair, as soon as we can get the receipt
from the store we bought it from.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Lucida Console" color="#6600FF">No pics
of MGM. As I said, the camera is acting up, and we can never tell when it's
going to work or not. The best thing at MGM by far was the Rockin' Roller
Coaster, by Aerosmith. It goes from 0-60, in something like 3/50ths of a second!
(I made that exact time up, but I bet it's close!) It was SOOOO fun! We went on
it twice: the first time Mom didn't go, and so we went back the next morning to
go again, and it was even better the second time! I loved it. The next best
thing at MGM though was the Animation tour. They showed you the short version of
how to make a animated movie, what jobs the animators have, and a sneak-peek at
Disney's next animated film! We even got to see the animators at work through
glass windows. It was very interesting.</font></p>

was the most fun (I think) at the Animal Kingdom. It was a raft ride, and then
when you get to the bottom of the big drop, there is a <i><b>huge</b></i>

the back both times we went on. You might say that I was in the <u>SOAKED!</u> category.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#009999">The
owner of the boat &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, Sherri, took us out to what they
call the &quot;Dolphin Playground&quot;, but for a while there weren't any signs of
the beautiful bottle-nosed dolphin, native to these parts of Florida. Finally,
we saw a pod close by, but they were all asleep! But not asleep to my standards,
because when a dolphin sleeps, only half of it's brain goes to sleep, so it can
keep breathing...otherwise they would drown. So, they were all swimming around
in a big circle, sometimes with their fins out of the water. Sherri played music
in the boat, so the dolphins could hear it. She says they really like it. We
even saw a pic of a guy playing a clarinet on a boat, and a dolphin swimming
right up to him!!! So the dolphins finally woke up, and we got to swim around
with them! They were smiling at us, playing, jumping and everything. We saw one
who had a sand dollar, and was throwing it to him/herself, and then falling back
to the water. It was amazing. The water was really warm and shallow too, around
74 degrees, and the water we were in was about 7' deep, and <i>so clear!!!</i>
You could see 15' down to the bottom, and see nothing but white sand. Oh, it was
<i>sooooo beautiful!!! </i>I had a fab time. It was really a bummer they could
only take the four of us...Mom and Dad couldn't come. It was very generous of
them to let us go. <i>Very.</i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#CC33FF">We were in Fort Pierce, at the Roadrunner PV park. It was pretty nice, complete
with pool, and both tennis and shuffle board courts. Jordan and I (of course)
took full advantage of the opportunity, and used all three.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#00CC66" face="Comic Sans MS">We had an incident
a while ago. Not just any incident, but a major-big-deal-one. We were on our way
to Miami, to pick up Angelika, when Dad noticed that the door of the trailer was
wide open, and had been for some time. We quickly pulled over in a rest station
and had a look. We discovered, that the door has slipped slightly off the
hinges, and slammed into the pin that is supposed to hold the door on, only it
missed. The result, was a huge hole in the wall of the trailer:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#00CC66" face="Comic Sans MS"><img border="0" src="images/113-1393a_IMG.JPG" width="219" height="155">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#00CC66" face="Comic Sans MS">Also, we
couldn't get the pin out of the door, which had the affect of a harpoon.
Finally, my Dad just pulled the pin anchor out of the wall, and wiggled the pin
out that way.&nbsp; The screen on the door, which we were counting on big time
in this hot weather, had blown off in the time the door had been flying around
on it's own. Unfortunately, Jordan had been the one to lock up the trailer
before we left, meaning that Jordan is the one responsible for all of our
problems with the door. Ouch<b>.</b>  This was the result...notice the
duct-tape:</font></p>

station that sunny afternoon...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#CC33FF">Well,
as the saying goes: The stupid forgive and forget, the mean-spirited don't
forgive OR forget, and the wise forgive, but don't forget. Ah well, that's not
the last you will hear about the Airstream door problems. :oC</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF6600">Angelika
is here! We picked her up in Miami, after she had endured a night in LA with a
United Airlines flight attendant, and many hours in airplanes and airports. We
drove to (through) the keys, and we are now quite happy with our place on the
Sugar Loaf Key.</font></p>

8th, 2 days before we are scheduled to be in Florida, a space shuttle will be

Prescott, and we are now in Williams, another small town in Arizona. We visited
the Grand Canyon...beautiful! And a ghost town!!! I was really exited to see it,
but, we didn't see a ghost...bummer! (Tee-Hee). The Grand Canyon
was...un-imaginable. It was really cool, and <u>SO</u> big! Mom, unfortunately,
was extremely afraid of the height, and the fact that the railing only went up
to mid-thigh! Here is a pic:</b></font></p>

the Treasure Island Pirate Show; Siegfried and Roy's white Tiger show; and the
