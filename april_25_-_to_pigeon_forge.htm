<p>The question was, of course, where to go next.&nbsp; We needed to stay within
striking distance of central North Carolina where we would be picking up Joya
and her friend Tessany on the fifth of May.&nbsp; A circumnavigation of
the Great Smokey Mountains National Park sounded interesting, so off we set,
bound for Southeastern Tennessee.&nbsp; On the North-central border of the park lay two
formerly-small towns, grown bloated by the popularity of the Smokies: Gatlinburg
and Pigeon Forge.&nbsp; Based on an examination of the road atlas, Pigeon Forge
seemed smaller and less known (hah!), and had a Passport America park there
where we could stay for about $13 a night.&nbsp; Passport America is a
&quot;discount club&quot; membership costing about $40 that we had purchased
back in New Mexico, where we receive a 50% discount at participating
parks.&nbsp; It has paid for itself 5 or 10 times over already.&nbsp; It has the
added bonus of mostly being offered by out-of-the-way parks, or parks that are
otherwise funky and in need of additional campers and revenue -- a perfect match
for our wants.</p>
<p>The drive West across US 321 was wonderful.&nbsp; The landscape of the
Smokies is so diverse -- the trees lend a multitude of colors to any hillside:
all the greens, some reds, and the occasional brilliant white of the flowering
dogwood.&nbsp; Tucked into the 'hollows' are 200 year old farmhouses, homes and
barns, made of hand-hewn notched logs.&nbsp; All of it passing by, at a
leisurely 35 or so miles per hour.&nbsp; The nomenclature of the Appalachian
region is also diverse and unique: there are hollows, gaps, nobs, coves, balds,
and branches, instead of the usual terms like valley, pass, creek, etc..&nbsp; It was one of the most pleasant drives of the trip so far; unfortunately,
it ended at one of the ugliest sights that we had yet seen -- Gatlinburg/Pigeon
Forge (they have nearly blended).</p>
<p>The Great Smokey Mountains National Park is the most visited park in the
United States.&nbsp; According to Bill Bryson, author of the exquisite &quot;A
Walk in the Woods&quot; which details his experiences walking 800 miles of the
Appalachian Trail, Gatlinburg is more popular than the park itself.&nbsp; No
one could capture the essence of Gatlinburg as Bryson has done, so I will not
try.&nbsp; I reproduce it here:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;[Gatlinburg] sits just outside the main entrance to the Great Smokey
  Mountains National Park and specializes in providing all those things that the
  park does not -- principally, slurpy food, motels, gift shops, and sidewalks
  on which to waddle and dawdle -- nearly all of it strewn along a single
  astoundingly ugly main street.&nbsp; For years it has prospered on the
  confident understanding that when Americans load up their cars and drive enormous
  distances to a setting of rare natural splendor what most of them want when
  they get there is to play a little miniature golf and eat dribbly food...Walking
  in an unhurried fashion up and down the street were more crowds of overweight
  tourists in boisterous clothes, with cameras bouncing on their bellies,
  consuming ice-creams, cotton candy, and corn dogs, sometimes
  simultaneously.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly for us, Pigeon Forge is even worse.&nbsp; At least in Gatlinburg there
was an attempt to have a 'mountain theme' in the architecture and
attractions.&nbsp; Pigeon Forge looks like nothing more than a giant strip mall
on steroids, running down both sides of the street.&nbsp; The birthplace of
Dolly Parton, she&nbsp; effectively ruined it when she built Dollywood there,
although its proximity to Gatlinburg most likely doomed it long ago.&nbsp;
Pigeon Forge does have 2 redeeming qualities: it is a very short drive from
there to the Great Smokey Mountains National Park, and it has a Krispy Kreme,
which we patronized both nights we were there.</p>
<p>We found our campground after some initial confused driving around in
Gatlinburg, and it was pleasant, with a nice creek running 20 years from our
campsite.&nbsp; The park was only about half full, and we got a site away from
most other folk.</p>
<p>There were numerous species of duck wintering on the creek.&nbsp; Below,
Jordan feeds some of them.&nbsp; There was a corn dispensing machine nearby, and
I was able to get some of the ducks to eat out of my hand.&nbsp; While we were
watching the creek, we saw a river otter slink down the far bank and into the
river, almost directly across from us.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; We watched it
swim along, both on top and under the surface, for perhaps 5 minutes before
losing track of it.</p>

Forge.</p>

<p>This RV park also sported a pool table (although it cost an exorbitant 75
cents per game), so that evening we had another of our family pool tournaments
prior to bed.</p>
