<p>We drove to St. Louis and went up the arch; well at least some of us went up the arch -- those of us who prefer to avoid extreme heights and/or confined
spaces opted to stay on the ground and browse the &quot;History of Westward
Expansion&quot; museum under the base of the arch.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Here are the ladies, posing under the arch before we went inside.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6573_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>Jordan and I got into the little tiny tram car with 3 other folks.&nbsp; Claustrophobics
need not apply -- each car is about as big as the inside of a VW Beetle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6575_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The view from the top was great, however.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6579m_IMG.JPG" width="627" height="212"></p>
<p>Another view of the arch, this time from the ground looking straight up one
of the two &quot;legs&quot;.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6583_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>After the arch, we walked up Washington Avenue, the heart of the old part of
downtown St. Louis.&nbsp; It was truly unsettling -- it was nearly deserted, and
all of the buildings stood empty.&nbsp; For 10 city blocks, almost no foot or
automobile traffic could be seen.&nbsp; It did not seem like a 'bad'
neighborhood, and there were some people about, but not nearly as many as we
expected to find at the heart of a big city.&nbsp; Apparently the city had
recently embarked upon a plan to rebuild and revitalize this section of town,
but it was one odd walk up to &quot;The City Museum&quot;, which was our
destination.</p>
<p>The City Museum is hard to describe.&nbsp; It is not a museum in any
traditional sense of the word.&nbsp; There are things to see and do, mostly
unrelated to each other.&nbsp; We loved it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is the largest pair of chonies ever made.&nbsp; To the right are photos
that underwear devotees have sent in, wearing their undies on their heads.&nbsp;
I am tempted...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6585_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>To get from the 2nd floor to the first, one can either take the stairway,
or...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6588a_IMG.JPG" width="527" height="960"></p>
<p>...Jody and I tried both.&nbsp; The slide was definitely faster, and lots
more fun.</p>
<p>There was also a master glassblower there.&nbsp; On request, he made a
perfectly spherical marble -- without molds.&nbsp; Below he is making a drinking
glass.&nbsp; He talked the entire time, which taught us a lot about the fine art
and craft of blowing glass.&nbsp; We probably spent an hour there.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6590a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Suspended on the ceiling of the first floor (but hidden from view) is a maze
of plastic tunnels leading to all sorts of interesting small rooms and
chambers.&nbsp; All 3 of us crawled through much of this, with Jordan in the
lead.</p>
<p>Jody, inside one of the little resting chambers.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6595a_IMG.JPG" width="551" height="661"></p>
<p>After exploring the passageway in front of us, advance scout Jordan returns
to make her report.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6596a_IMG.JPG" width="481" height="503"></p>
<p>This 'tunnel' was made of iron bars, suspended from the ceiling.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6602_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>Jordan emerges from a hollowed out log which was converted to a tunnel of
sorts.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6606a_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>On the 3rd floor of the museum we found an exhibit of architectural
ornaments, many taken from St. Louis buildings prior to demolition.</p>
<p>Here are two of my favorites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6610a_IMG.JPG" width="558" height="728"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6612_IMG.JPG" width="557" height="420"></p>
<p>There was also the largest collection of doorknobs I could imagine, as well
as hinges and other hardware -- all of it beautiful.&nbsp; We all had a grand
time at this museum -- really interesting, and really fun, with none of the
stuffiness one often finds in institutions labeled 'museum'.</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/expeditn/exphorsa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p>We were actually camped on the Illinois side, in a little town called
Cahokia.&nbsp; Nearby was a state park containing some of the largest mounds of
the Mississippian Mound Builders, a Native American culture that flourished from
about 900 to 1400 A.D.&nbsp; Cahokia was a prominent and populous city -- by
1450 it had around 20,000 people living in and around it, making it larger than
London England at the same time.</p>
<p>The mounds that they built were extraordinary.&nbsp; The photo below depicts
an artist's vision of what Cahokia looked like at its peak.&nbsp; Note the huge
mound at the right rear of the scene, now known as Monk's Mound.&nbsp; It took
300 years to build that, by hand.&nbsp; An estimated 15 million baskets full of
earth were moved to create just that one mound, and there were 122 known mounds
at this site alone.&nbsp; They were an amazingly advanced culture; they even had
a solar calendar made of 48 posts, which is now known as woodhenge.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/166-6619M_IMG.JPG" width="714" height="201"></p>
<p>Here is Monk's Mound as it is today.&nbsp; The top is still quite flat.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/166-6645m_IMG.JPG" width="588" height="208"></p>
<p>The ladies posed at the top.&nbsp; You can see St. Louis in the background,
with the arch dimly visible at left.&nbsp; The city of Cahokia extended all the
way to St. Louis -- there was a mound standing in the spot where the arch now
stands.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/166-6641_IMG.JPG" width="705" height="531"></p>
<p>It was quite windy at the top, as you can see, although it was quite a
welcome breeze -- the temperature was in the 90s that day.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/166-6643_IMG.JPG" width="659" height="495"></p>
<p>Jordan descends the mound in her own unique style.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/166-6644_IMG.JPG" width="468" height="624"></p>
<p>Part of the park included an excellent interpretive center, with many
dioramas depicting how various anthropologists and archeologists envisioned life
in Cahokia.&nbsp; The descendants of Cahokia are unknown; Cahokia slowly
declined, until it was entirely abandoned and its peoples dispersed.</p>
<p>One shot of one of the dioramas.&nbsp; Jody loves dioramas.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/166-6632a_IMG.JPG" width="574" height="473"></p>
<p>Another diorama shot, this time of a winter scene.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/10/166-6635a_IMG.JPG" width="634" height="394"></p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/expeditn/exphorsa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p>We next got in a visit with the Bernard family.&nbsp; Ellen Bernard and Joya
had been good friends since they were 5 or 6.&nbsp; Ellen's sister Cora is a bit
younger than Jordan.&nbsp; The girls and their mother, Joanie, had lived in our
studio for a year or so, so our families had become friends.</p>
<p>Below you can see us, and Cora, Joan, Claude and Ellen.&nbsp; We had a nice
dinner at the Bernard's home, after which we went for a walk over the the St.
Louis Art Faire, in Clayton.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6654a_IMG.JPG" width="518" height="430"></p>
<p>St. Louis has a lot of street art, which we found interesting and fun.&nbsp;
Below is a sculpture made of nickels and pennies.&nbsp; At his lapel is a slot
for depositing coins -- he is really a gigantic piggy bank.&nbsp; The monies
collected go toward a local charity.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6657_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>Also at the Art Faire were these dubious-looking types.&nbsp; They are
life-sized polyester resin sculptures, with 20 coats of paint or plaster to make
them lifelike.&nbsp; They were amazing.&nbsp; The artist used body-casts as
molds for some of his figures, prosthetic eyes, and real hair.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6651a_IMG.JPG" width="416" height="280"></p>
<p>Ellen and Cora opted to stay overnight with us.&nbsp; The next day, the 3
girls got in a good swim at the campground pool.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6661_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6662_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We dropped the girls off at their home, and got hugs all around.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6668a_IMG.JPG" width="624" height="579"></p>
<p>After dropping off the girls, we decided to take in a Cardinals game at Busch
Stadium.&nbsp; It took us an hour or so to find parking.&nbsp; We bought tickets
from a scalper for $10 a piece.&nbsp; He told us they were good seats; you can
see how high up we were.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6673_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>The Cardinals were playing the Dodgers -- the Dodgers lost, 5-6.&nbsp; Below
is Mark McGuire himself at bat.&nbsp; We did not see him hit any homeruns,
though.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/166-6672_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>And then we drove on West...</p>
