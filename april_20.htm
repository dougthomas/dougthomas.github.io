We got up, made some banana nut muffins, and headed to Advance. Our mail was
waiting!&nbsp; Most of the mail was discouraging bill type stuff, but -- hooray!
--&nbsp; the digital camera
was there, too. We are so happy to have it back.&nbsp; Canon fixed it on warranty and
it seems to work well again.
<p>Kristin, our sister-in-law, and our nieces and nephew were staying with Karen
and Chris Nard, Kristin's sister and brother-in-law.&nbsp; Are you following this?
There will be a test.&nbsp; Just to help you out, you can study the picture
below.&nbsp; Sorta left to right: Nathan, Max, Jordan, Karen/McKenna/Avery,
Lauren, Shannon, Chris, Kristin, and Doug, who is grimacing so badly because his
sister-in-law Kristin is clearly administering the Vulcan Death Grip to his
shoulder. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1922a_IMG.JPG" width="435" height="366"> </p>
<p>Karen and Chris just had their third baby, a girl
named Avery.&nbsp; We showed up at Karen's house sometime in the late morning and got
a visit in with everyone.&nbsp; Then, Kristin, Lauren, Shannon, Nathan, McKenna,
Jordan, Doug and Jody all left for a walk through &quot;Old Salem&quot;. </p>
<p>On our way in to see Old Salem, a disheveled black gentleman approached us
and began speaking rapidly almost before we were close enough to hear him.&nbsp;
He first words and gestures were that he was unarmed so don't worry (he opened
up his jacket to show us), and he then asked us where the road above us
went.&nbsp; We said we did not know.&nbsp; He said, &quot;You from out of
town?&quot;, and we said yes.&nbsp; He left.&nbsp; This was odd and sad, but
worse yet, after he left us he went over to a single man who clearly worked for
Old Salem and asked him something.&nbsp; After a brief exchange, the black man
walked away and the Old Salem worker came over and asked us if the black man had
asked us for money.&nbsp; We said no.&nbsp; He said that maybe that man would
appreciate spending a night in the Salem jail, and he stalked off after the
black man, with a zealot's focus.&nbsp; His racism was apparent; simply because
this was a possibly homeless black man, he was to be chased down.&nbsp; It left
a bad taste in our mouths. </p>
<p>Old Salem is an old community founded by a religious sect called the Moravians. They
were German immigrants here in this country doing what all the religious
immigrants were doing -- hoping to be able to live their lives as they wanted to
rather than as their government wanted them to.&nbsp; Old Salem was a
&quot;church town&quot;.&nbsp; Everything was dictated by the church leadership.&nbsp;
The
leadership was male and female -- very progressive for the time.&nbsp; All
children were
educated from 6 to 14.&nbsp; Girls then began working for income and supported
themselves in the girls' house.&nbsp; Boys apprenticed as a tradesman until they were
able to do the trade and support themselves in the young men's house, called
&quot;The Single Men's Choir&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their use of the word 'choir'
simply meant group.&nbsp; The rules
were strict, like the Pilgrims or Shakers or Amish or many others.&nbsp; The church
intentionally kept members away from &quot;strangers&quot; as much as possible.&nbsp;
The style of housing and gardening was German and the craftsmanship was
excellent.&nbsp; Old Salem is a Living History museum (Jody's favorite kind) and
was done really well. </p>
<p>Below is a shot of the Single Men's Choir, with a lovely dogwood in the
foreground. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1905_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>McKenna's amazing eyes gaze back at the camera as Nathan helps grind some
fresh-roasted coffee beans.&nbsp; After the fire roasting and grinding, there
was of course the brewing.&nbsp; The coffee was not as strong as we like it, but
was still good nonetheless. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1909_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>In the attic of one of the restored homes the kids discovered a box of
authentic reproduction 18th century clothes for them to try on.&nbsp; This is
the result.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1913_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>Salem was a highly regimented town, with rules for everything, including
those pertaining to 'necessities', a common euphemism for privy, outhouse or
chamber pot. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1915_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"> </p>
<p>This shot is a lovely example of the architecture and building styles used in
the late 1700s. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1916_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>Jody gave Nathan a piggy back ride towards the end of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Looking at old buildings is as exciting to a 6 year old as watching paint dry is
to you or I, so he was dragging a bit.&nbsp; At this point, I believe we were on
the way to the bakery and sandwich shop for a snack.&nbsp; We bought 4 apple
strudels, which were deemed excellent by all (McKenna admitted she really only
liked the apples in the strudel). </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1917_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"> </p>
<p>Chris, Karen, Max, McKenna and Avery generously treated us to dinner that
night at the West End Cafe -- that is where Jody took the first picture on this
page.&nbsp; After dinner, Chris and Karen took us on a new culinary adventure:
our first Krispy Creme. </p>
<p>Depending on who you ask, Krispy Kreme is either just another doughnut shop,
a purveyor of junk food, a brilliant and popular brand, a way of life, a wonderland
of sweetness, or a cult religion.&nbsp; Found mainly in the South and East,
although it is spreading, we are now converts, brought to see the light
(literally -- see the pic below) by newfound Brother Chris.&nbsp; He explained
that when the red neon light is now, they are making fresh, hot doughnuts.&nbsp;
It was quite a sight.&nbsp; Krispy Kreme has a machine like something out of
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory -- a gigantic, room-sized doughnut making
machine that eats dough and spits out perfect doughnuts from the other end --
all in a matter of a few minutes.&nbsp; I don't know what the production
capacity of this device is, but some lady came in and ordered 6 dozen doughnuts,
and walked away with them some small number of minutes later -- all cooked
fresh. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1924a_IMG.JPG" width="417" height="384"> </p>
<p>After being automatically fried on both sides, the doughnuts pass through the
glazing machine, as seen below.&nbsp; It is a vision to behold. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1925_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"> </p>
<p>After coming off the glazer, the ready-to-eat beauties are delivered up for
boxing -- most folk order them by the dozen.&nbsp; They even have a drive
through window. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1930_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>Below you can see that Jody is intently studying the exquisite flavor of a
just-out-of the glazer Krispy Kreme.&nbsp; The wonderful folks who worked there
gave us free samples after hearing that we were Krisy Kreme virgins.&nbsp; They
were more excited than we were -- they gave us the sample just to watch the
beaming radiance coming from the faces of those who are consuming the heavenly
host for the first time.&nbsp; They truly are amazing.&nbsp; Light as air
almost. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1927_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"> </p>
<p>The 3 little Krispy Kreme piglets scarfed lots of doughnuts.&nbsp; Shannon
managed to sell her free hat to some guy for two dollars, much to her mother's
chagrin. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1933_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>After Shannon's successful foray into the hat business, McKenna danced around
chanting &quot;hat for sale!&quot;.&nbsp; She got no takers, sadly, although she
was cute as hell in her hat, as you can see below. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1934_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>Not to be left out of the monkey business, the boys opted to wear their hats
upside down.&nbsp; I managed to catch this picture of them while they were still
groggy from all the sugar they consumed -- normally they would have made silly
faces at the camera. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/119-1939_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"> </p>
<p>We all left in the exalted state that only comes from lots of sugary fried
dough, and headed back to Chris and Karen's.&nbsp; Jordan managed to wrangle an
overnight stay with her cousins and second-cousins-somehow-removed, so Jody and
I went back to the trailer alone -- the first time on the trip :) </p>
