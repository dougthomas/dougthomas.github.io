  <p>We decided to 'do' Philadelphia mostly because we were in the neighborhood,
  so to speak.&nbsp; As you most likely have noted, we are largely avoiding
  large cities on this adventure, but we are making some exceptions; the
  revolutionary history of this very old city called to us.
  </p>
<p>On the drive back East through Pennsylvania, Jody noted a small red square on
our road atlas labeled &quot;Coral Caves&quot;.&nbsp; As it looked to be only a
few minutes off the interstate (we were attempting to cross the whole state in
one day, and so chose the fastest route as opposed to the most interesting), we
negotiated the small country roads to a small hilltop within the village of
Mann's Choice, PA.
  </p>
<p>The caves were entirely privately owned by a family.&nbsp; We paid the $8 or
so a piece, and took the little tour.&nbsp; Our tour guide was very young and
quite rigid in her delivery, but it was still fun and interesting.&nbsp; The
caves were a nice cool 50 degrees, a welcome relief from the mid 80s.
  </p>
<p>That is Joya below, looking up at some of the stalactites -- or are they
stalagmites?
  </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/137-3787a_IMG.JPG" width="514" height="465"></p>
<p>Apparently cave owners feel compelled to give names to imagined shapes found
in caves; ours certainly did.&nbsp; The &quot;dramatically lit&quot; scene below
they called the Nativity, with the lumpy shapes in the foreground serving as
stand-in wise men.&nbsp; We oohed and aahed appropriately.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/137-3797a_IMG.JPG" width="558" height="414"></p>
<p>After the short tour covering about 600 feet, we returned to the surface and
continued our drive East.&nbsp; As it turns out, the nearest campground to
Philly is in New Jersey, so that was our destination.</p>
<p>Philadelphia was an easy 20 minute drive across the Walt Whitman
bridge.&nbsp; This early in the season, there was plenty of cheap parking down
on the waterfront at Penn's Landing, which is very near to the historic district
in South Philly.</p>
<p>We started things off with a look at the National Liberty Museum, which is
dedicated to those who have advanced the cause of Liberty both in the US and
abroad.&nbsp; Below is a vase created by Dale Chilhuly, who you may remember
from the Las Vegas segment of our little saga.&nbsp; Mr. Chilhuly has created
large glass art installations all over the world.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3803a_IMG.JPG" width="509" height="525"></p>
<p>Below we paused in a &quot;Cosi&quot; cafe for some smoothies and iced
coffees -- it was very hot our entire stay in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3823a_IMG.JPG" width="535" height="322"></p>
<p>This is the required shot of the Liberty Bell, which is no longer hanging in Independence
Hall, visible in the background of the picture below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3825a_IMG.JPG" width="422" height="436"></p>
<p>And this is the room where the 2nd Continental Congress met and drafted the
Declaration of Independence.&nbsp; None of the furniture is original except for
the large chair at the rear of the photo -- it was all auctioned off long ago,
after it had become a bit worn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3828_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>For 10 years, Philadelphia was the capitol of the United States -- during the
decade of the 1790s.&nbsp; The photo below show part of the Senate chamber used
during that time.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3831_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>The photo below is a reconstruction of what the Library of Congress looked
like when it was first established -- the books you can see on those shelves
were all they had.&nbsp; Remember that books back then were very expensive.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3834a_IMG.JPG" width="612" height="345"></p>
<p>As interesting as all this revolutionary history was, the girls had pretty
much had their fill of &quot;monuments to dead white guys&quot;, as they began
referring to them.&nbsp; So we segued into Philly's Chinatown, which was very
fun.&nbsp; We found an excellent vegetarian Chinese restaurant not far from
where the shot below was taken.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3838_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>We also found time to take a self-guided tour of the Philadelphia Mint, which
we all found interesting.&nbsp; This mint makes many military medals, including
the Silver Star and Purple Heart, both of which Jody's cousin Phil had earned,
so seeing those was nice.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3848_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After our Mint tour, we went over to Ben Franklin's former stomping
grounds.&nbsp; The woman below is playing the first musical instrument invented
in America.&nbsp; Called the &quot;Armonica&quot;, it is a series of nesting
crystal bowls which the player keeps wet.&nbsp; The nested bowls are rotated
slowly as the player runs her fingers over them to create notes.&nbsp; The
resulting&nbsp; music is beautiful, with a haunting quality.&nbsp; She played an
astonishing version of amazing grace that sent shivers up our spines.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3852_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Next stop (and next day) was Little Italy in South Philly.&nbsp; It was grand
-- just like being in a small neighborhood in Rome, with the bonus that everyone
spoke English as well as Italian.&nbsp; The shot below is of the De Bruno
brother's cheese store.&nbsp; We just stood in it, grinning, for perhaps 30
minutes, absorbing the odors and ambiance.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3868_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>Another street shot of Little Italy.&nbsp; We especially enjoyed the paint
job in process on the upper buildings.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3869_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>I am not sure what Jordan is attempting to communicate here, but I loved the
street scene surrounding her.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3874_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>And so we left Philadelphia -- we stayed 2 days longer than we had originally
planned -- and continued East towards New York.&nbsp; We did not make it across
the New Jersey Turnpike without trouble, however.&nbsp; The photo below captures
me untying the spare tire for the trailer.&nbsp; Yes, we had another blow out,
this time on the inside, away from the traffic.&nbsp; The gentleman in white
that you see is a NJ turnpike employee who noticed we were having problems and
stopped to set up flares and make sure we could change the tire unaided (I did,
although it is a mighty pain in the butt).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/138-3879_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>So, running on the spare, we limped into New York and continued driving
through the nasty New York traffic, halfway up Long Island to our campground.</p>
