<p>With apologies to Bill Bryson, the above seemed the best title for this page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We awoke to &quot;fairy&quot; music coming from the woods.&nbsp; It was faint
and ethereal.&nbsp; We don't know where it came from, but it was a magical
sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4 day hike we had chosen began with a short shuttle via boat to Hazel Creek, on the
North side of Fontana Lake, exorbitantly priced at $40 one way for the three of
us.&nbsp; Here is the view of the lake, en route. </p>
<img border="0" src="images/120-2080_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
<p>The boat dropped us at the end of one of the lake's fingers, where Hazel
Creek emptied out.&nbsp; All of the walking this day was on broad, smooth, leaf-strewn
former wagon roads.&nbsp; This region was a populace place in the 1800s.&nbsp;
The town of Proctor once sat about both sides of Hazel Creek, in the picture
below.&nbsp; Proctor died off when the timber in this area was logged out -- most of
the trees in this section of the Smokies are only 80 years or so old.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/120-2081_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The walking was level and incredibly pleasant; shaded from the sun, we never
got too hot.&nbsp; Since we were walking in on a Sunday, we passed many people
walking out -- 24 of them, to be precise.&nbsp; We had heard that the Smokies
were busy, but 24 coming out on an April weekend, early in the season, gave us
some pause.&nbsp; Even so, we were mostly entirely alone the entire 4 days.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/120-2083_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>After a short walk of 4.8 miles, we arrived at our backcountry campsite (#84,
Sugar Fork, in case you care to look at a trail map) in the early afternoon.&nbsp; Camping anywhere in the Smokies must
be done only in campsites, and nowhere else -- GSMNP is rife with such rules.&nbsp; The camp was entirely empty,
but showed clear signs that many of those 24 folk who passed us earlier had
camped there.&nbsp; We set about setting up camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/120-2087a_IMG.JPG" align="left" width="245" height="586">At
left, Jordan hangs our food.&nbsp; At this campground there were lovely
food-hanging cables all set up, so food-hanging was a snap (you can't really see
the cables in the picture, but they are there).&nbsp; This was really a treat,
since hanging food could be a real pain if proper tree limbs cannot be found,
which is usually the case.&nbsp; During our first day of hiking in the Sierras last year
with our dear friends the Engles, it took
several of us nearly an hour to hang food, and was not completed until well
after full dark -- when bears normally feed.&nbsp; This caused us undue anxiety,
which we were really happy to avoid while in the bear-infested Smokies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan is building the fire while I set up the stove in preparation for
dinner.&nbsp; There were no mosquitoes, but there were annoying little gnat-like
insects (Bryson called them black flies) that
hovered incessantly about our faces, occasionally flying directly into our
eyes.&nbsp; We found that they hated fires, so we kept a small 'Indian fire'
going much of the time -- this did the trick nicely.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/120-2088_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After camp was set up, the ladies enjoyed some Gin Rummy, using a
conveniently flat rock as a card table.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/120-2089_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>While the ladies played cards, I read up on &quot;Trees of the Smokies&quot;,
and napped.&nbsp; In the foreground is our clothesline.&nbsp; We had all bathed
and washed out our clothes (water temperature: AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/120-2090_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Dinner that night was extravagant -- Jambalaya.&nbsp; We all ate
ravenously.&nbsp; It was exquisite.&nbsp; Before full dark, we retired to bed to
read aloud more of Bryson's book, with the 2 creeks roaring in the
background.&nbsp; I slept grandly; Jody did not -- she stayed awake much of the
night, straining to hear bear-snuffling sounds that could not be heard above the
water noise.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had mixed feelings about a black bear encounter --
we really wanted to see one, but from a safe distance, with no cubs about, with
the bear clearly utterly uninterested in us.&nbsp; As bears are nocturnal, this
was not likely; most bear encounters are at night.&nbsp; And we definitely did
not want to experience a bear at night, in our camp.</p>
