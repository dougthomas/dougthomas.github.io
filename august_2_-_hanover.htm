  <p>Hanover, New Hampshire, was just across the Connecticut river, which
  separates the two states.&nbsp; We had two things we wanted to see while
  there: Dartmouth College, and Bill Bryson; this was Bryson's home town.&nbsp;
  If you don't know who Bryson is by now, I simply can't help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Sadly, we failed to encounter Mr. Bryson wandering the streets in search of loyal fans, but
  we did purchase yet another of his books, this time &quot;The Lost
  Continent&quot;, which appears to be his search for &quot;the perfect US
  town&quot;; he chose Hanover as his home, and we think there is a connection
  there.&nbsp; &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; makes our fourth Bryson work.&nbsp; Mostly we read
  them aloud in the evenings while everyone is in bed.&nbsp; They are all
  insightful, wonderfully written, and utterly hilarious.
  </p>
<p>While wandering about Dartmouth, we discovered a tour being conducted for
  incoming freshmen.&nbsp; After inquiring if we could join and being told that
  we could, we got a nice concise one hour tour of campus, led by an
  upperclassman.&nbsp; We were quite impressed with the school; it had a nice
feel, and strove to create well-rounded people from its students.&nbsp;
Dartmouth is a very exclusive liberal arts college, letting in only 1/10 of its
applicants each year.&nbsp; It is also very expensive, at about $35,000 per year
for tuition, books, room and board.&nbsp; Quite a lot of emphasis is placed on
physical fitness.&nbsp; Most undergrads also study abroad for a time.&nbsp;
Their is ample housing available for all students, and very flexible meal plan
options.&nbsp; Joya was fairly non-committal, but did express concern with the 6
months of cold and snow that constitutes a New Hampshire winter.
  </p>
  <p>Here is a picture of the Dartmouth 'green', which in Winter must seem and
  odd name for this space.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/5/154-5402m_IMG.JPG" width="706" height="168">
  </p>
  <p>Almost exactly from where the above picture was taken, we found the plaque
  below embedded in the sidewalk -- we were back again on the Appalachian Trail,
  which goes right through downtown Hanover (and apparently Bill Bryson's backyard, a bit
  further on).
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/5/154-5401a_IMG.JPG" width="532" height="314">
  </p>
  <p>The Dartmouth Canoe Club rented canoes by the hour, and it being a hot day,
  this sounded great, so we donned our bathing suits and walked down to the
  river.&nbsp; We opted for 2 boats, selected our paddle mates, and headed into
  the wind.
  </p>
  <p>Jody and Joya started off together, with Jody in the rear, but this was
  proving difficult, so we switched partners, with Joya steering her boat, and I
  steering Jody and mine.&nbsp; This was a more harmonious combination.&nbsp; We
  made good time, and had one.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/5/154-5427_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
  </p>
  <p>While we stopped for lunch at a little sandy area, the girls <i>tried </i>to paddle the canoes by themselves for a bit, but after Joya almost got
  sucked by the wind out of the little bay they were safely paddling in, they both wisely gave it
  up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/5/154-5424_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">

  <p>Jody and I eating lunch after a swim.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/5/154-5418_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
  </p>
<p>When we were walking down to the canoe rental&nbsp;we had seen two collage
boys coming out of the water, and they said that the water was nice, and that
they had just jumped off of the bridge!&nbsp; So, of course, Joya wanted to
also.&nbsp; In fact, she did jump -- twice!&nbsp; She caused quite a bit of grief for
her mother -- and some for her normally unflappable father.&nbsp; Jody&nbsp; took these
pics, while I stayed in the water to make sure she came up.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/5/154-5438a_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800">
  </p>
  <p>The drop was a good 30 to 40 feet -- quite a fall.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/5/154-5437a_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800">
  </p>
  <p>As we paddled back, the girls were clearly plotting to splash the parents,
  so Jody and I took evasive action.&nbsp; A bit too evasive, I am afraid: while
  we were both frantically paddling -- foolishly, on the same side of the canoe
  -- I managed to lean out too far, and in slow motion, in full view of the
  girls, Jody and I dumped ourselves out of the canoe.&nbsp; They thought it was
  the funniest thing they had ever seen.&nbsp; I had a tense moment as I rescued
  the camera, which was still strapped to my waist.&nbsp; We were lucky -- it
  sustained no damage, as I had wrapped it in a plastic bag.&nbsp; Luckier
  still, the canoe took on almost no water, so all we had to do was get back
  in.&nbsp; If you have ever gotten into a canoe that is sitting right next to a
  nice, still dock, you can appreciate that it can be tricky.&nbsp; Getting in
  while you are thrashing about in the middle of a large river is indeed
  challenging.&nbsp; We managed it, with one of us on either side of the
  boat.&nbsp; Watching this process was almost as amusing for the girls as was
  watching us fall out in the first place.&nbsp; Well, laughter is supposed to
  be good for the body; we clearly take good care of our girls.
