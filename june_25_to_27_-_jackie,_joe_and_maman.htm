  <p>While we attended wedding festivities we had stayed in a hotel
  nearby.&nbsp; We returned to our campground on Sunday afternoon to get out of
  our 'good' clothes and return to camping-mode.&nbsp; When we got there, we
  encountered a nice couple who had managed to lose their car keys somewhere
  near the bathrooms, and were thus marooned for the night.&nbsp; We gave them
  blankets and pillows to make their forced stay more comfortable, and then the
  next morning Kenny and Jordan brought them over coffee and bagels.&nbsp; They were
  effusive in their thanks, and visited with us for a while on Monday
  morning.&nbsp; Below you can see Tony Torres giving us his phone numbers while
  his wife, Felicita looks on.&nbsp; They offered us their beach-front condo in Puerto Rico
  if we are ever in the neighborhood.&nbsp; You can be sure that we have filed
  away the numbers in hopes of taking them up on their offer, although it
  clearly won't be anytime soon.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/140-4089_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
  </p>
  <p>We began the long drive down Long Island, towards Queens.&nbsp; The
  next night we were to stay with Mike and Amira in Mardi and Maria's
  apartment so that we could get in and out of Manhattan more easily.&nbsp; We
  found their place and dropped off Kenny, who had stayed the night with
  us.&nbsp; Michael drove us to the nearby subway station, and we rode in to the
  city for our rendezvous with my parents and grandmother.
  </p>
<p>We exited the subway, bought some street vendor goodies, and walked across
town to 12th Avenue.&nbsp; On the way, Jody smelled a familiar smell, and we
came upon a building displaying this sign:
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4102a_img.jpg" width="298" height="208" align="left">Horses!&nbsp;
  Lots of them, all beautiful animals.&nbsp; We stopped and watched one of the
  officers groom for a bit, while another officer told us that they were
  preparing for a Yankees baseball game happening later that day.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/2/140-4096a_img.jpg" width="600" height="574">
  </p>
  <p>Somehow, none of us had managed to bring a watch with us that day.&nbsp;
  So, even though we had allowed plenty of time, our various dallyings nearly
  made us miss our meeting: my dad was waiting for us at the Circle Line docks,
  and
  our boat was to leave in 10 minutes.&nbsp; We all got quick 'hello hugs', and
  boarded the boat for a 3 hour tour all the way around Manhattan, which we all
  found fun and interesting.&nbsp; The tour was accompanied by a lively narrative which gave us lots
  of the history of Manhattan and the surrounding areas.&nbsp; Here we all are, enjoying the weather and the
  views.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4109_IMG.JPG" width="667" height="503">
  </p>
  <p>Of course, we made a mandatory loop around the Statue of Liberty.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4118a_IMG.JPJ.jpg" width="310" height="456">
  </p>
  <p>And here are my folks, Joe and Jackie Thomas, as we chatted and looked out of the
  windows.&nbsp; It was really great to see them again.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4132a_IMG.JPg" width="610" height="266">&nbsp;
  </p>
<p>And this is my maternal grandmother, Beverly Kunkel, whom I have called 'mamán'
(French for mother and pronounced 'Maah-Mah' by our family) all my life.&nbsp; It was truly
a huge gift she gave us by traveling all the way out to New York from her home
in Orange County, California.&nbsp; We are so appreciative that she was able to
make the long and tiring trip back East to see us.
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/2/140-4077a_IMG.JPG" width="380" height="573">
  </p>
<p>Here is one of the many great Manhattan skyline views we got as we traveled
around the island -- this view is of Lower Manhattan and the Financial District,
for those of you who are New York-a-philes.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4129a_IMG.JPG" width="625" height="311">
  </p>
  <p>While we circled Manhattan, we encountered nearly every type of bridge
  imaginable: drawbridges, suspension, and even a bridge that could be raised
  and lowered on pylons, like an elevator.&nbsp; The one pictured below was
  oddest of all: it operated like a record turntable, pivoting out of the way to
  allow ships to pass.&nbsp; You see it in mid-pivot.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4175a_img.jpg" width="639" height="246">
  </p>
  <p>When we had first arrived at our campground, I met a nice man in the
  bathroom.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; His name was Mike, and he was a retired
  Manhattan Garbage man.&nbsp; He now had 3 homes and was decked out in lots of
  gold, so I guess trash collecting in New York pays pretty well.
  </p>
<p>Anyway, we probed Mike for New York information, and among his interesting
stories, he told us Luna's in Little Italy (pronounced Litl It-Ly) was
good.&nbsp; So, when my parents asked me where we should eat, I told them about
Mike's recommendation, and that's where we went, in two cabs since there were so
many of us.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4187_IMG.JPG" width="367" height="274" align="left">
  Little Italy is a slowly-shrinking neighborhood in Manhattan, as it is being
  encroached upon by Chinatown next door.&nbsp; At the heart of Little Italy is
  Mulberry Street; Luna's is at Mulberry very near Canal, again for those
  of you who know Manhattan.&nbsp; As we neared the restaurant, the streets
  became packed with people of all colors.&nbsp; Street vendors were everywhere, all engaged in the
  hustle-bustle that characterizes the best of Manhattan's neighborhoods.&nbsp;
  My grandmother looked out the window at one point and said, &quot;My, Douglas,
  this is an interesting neighborhood&quot; as she reached over and locked the
  cab's door.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Since we were dining early we had no trouble getting a table.&nbsp; The
  restaurant was fabulous -- exactly what I'd hoped.&nbsp; Excellent Italian
  food, large portions, and reasonable prices. Apparently it was quite the
  hangout in former times, since there were dozens of autographed black and
  white photos of celebrities hanging on the walls, thanking the proprietor and praising the food.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4183a_IMG.JPG" width="533" height="358">
  </p>
<p>We departed with over-full bellies, and my dad and I went out to Canal to
hail cabs.&nbsp; Despite hearing that this could be tough, we never waited more
than a few minutes, despite needing 2 cabs whenever all 7 of us went out and
about.&nbsp; Maybe being 6'2'' helps.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4191_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
  </p>
  <p>Here is the scene outside the restaurant -- quintessential New York.&nbsp;
  Marvelous!
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4186_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
  </p>
  <p>We cabbed over to the their hotel, The Wyndham, in midtown around 58th.&nbsp; They had been
  upgraded to corner suites with kitchens.&nbsp; It was really remarkable --
  each of their suites was larger than our house back in Santa
  Barbara.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>We said good night to my grandmother, and visited for a bit with my parents
  in the living room of their suite.&nbsp; They offered to pay our cab fare back
  to Queens, as opposed to our plan of riding the subway; as it was after 10 PM
  we took them up on their offer, and $20 later were back at Mardi and Maria's
  apartment, visiting for a bit with the Elgans before retiring.
  </p>
  <p>The next day we again took the subway in to the city, this time
  rendezvousing for breakfast at The Wyndham.&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, we
  all had quite a scare: my grandmother fell in the ladies room, and was quite
  shook up as a result, although nothing was broken.
  </p>
  <p>This day we separated into 3 groups: my mother and grandmother went to Saks
  Fifth Avenue; Jody and the girls went shopping, while my dad and I toured the Museum of
  Natural History.&nbsp; The plan was to meet up back at the Wyndham sometime
  around 3:00 or so.
  </p>
<p>My dad and I had a great time at the museum.&nbsp; We both like the same
types of exhibits, and so spent the bulk of our time at the planetarium, and
looking at the dinosaur exhibits.&nbsp; It was really special for me to spend
one-on-one time with my dad -- I cannot recall the last time I had the
opportunity.&nbsp; The planetarium show was spectacular -- something like
&quot;powers of ten&quot;, if you have ever seen that, but projected onto a
planetarium dome that completely filled our field of vision.
  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jody and the girls made a bee line to F.A.O. Schwartz, where they
spent two hours looking at the Limited Edition Barbie stuff, the
&quot;Eloise&quot; exhibit, the candy department, and
trying out all sorts of wondrous toys and such, like the pair of roller-skate
tennis shoes that Joya is whizzing along in, below.&nbsp; Joya and Jordan each
bought only $10 worth of merchandise -- all candy.&nbsp; Such restraint.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4198_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640">
  </p>
  <p>Our homeschooling friends, the Stufflebeam family, started a toy business a
  couple of years ago, and lo and behold: the girls found their product, the <a href="http://www.beamo.com">Beamo</a>,
  on display at the pre-eminent toy store in the world.&nbsp; Congratulations
  Stufflebeams!
  </p>
  <p>This girls did a small demonstration for some customers while they were
  there.&nbsp; (Note to Stufflebeams: you can send their commission check to our
  Florida address).
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/141-4200a_IMG.JPG" width="628" height="597">
  </p>
  <p>Next stop for the girls: Tiffany's, where they ogled the 4 stories of amazing and
  expensive baubles that a few tens of thousands of dollars can purchase there.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4201a_IMG.JPG" width="573" height="145">
  </p>
<p>They snapped this photo before one of the clerks asked them to stop --
  photos are not allowed.&nbsp; Apparently they fear jewelry-design espionage,
as if a competitor bent on copying their designs could not simply walk in and
take a look.&nbsp; Brilliant.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4203_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
  </p>
<p>The ladies also shopped at the &quot;Gap&quot;, where the highlight was
seeing a pregnant Jody Foster shopping for red sneakers for her toddler.
  </p>
  <p>My mother and grandmother were also successful in their shopping
  expedition.&nbsp; My grandmother purchased a lovely scarf a Saks Fifth Avenue.
  </p>
  <p>That night for dinner we opted for a nearby fusion restaurant, featuring
  hybrid French and Japanese menu items.&nbsp; It sounds weird, but it worked
  really well.&nbsp; I had an inside-out style tuna roll with lots of wasabi,
  and a Caesar salad.&nbsp; Below, Joya tries dipping her french fry into my
  wasabi/shoyu sauce, with mixed results. WAAASSSABBIII!
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4224a_img.jpg" width="424" height="586">
  </p>
<p>Dinner was excellent.&nbsp; At its conclusion, we all said our goodbyes and
headed off in separate directions.&nbsp; I steered us into a nearby subway
tunnel that looked promising, and we boarded what looked to be the perfect line,
only to have it stop at a station halfway to Queens -- end of the line.&nbsp; We
rode it back to Rockefeller Center and got on the right train, and then walked
back to the Queens apartment.
  </p>
<p>The next day we left New York, headed for Annapolis.&nbsp; On the way down we
stopped at Teddy Roosevelt's country home, Sagamore Hill.&nbsp; Gorgeous home,
dreadful decor, as measured in contemporary terms.&nbsp; The house was literally
filled with dead stuffed animals of every type.&nbsp; Animal skin rugs were in
every room.&nbsp; Mr. Roosevelt was quite the big game hunter, and proud of his
kills.&nbsp; He was also the first conservationist president.&nbsp; It made for
an odd combination: a conservationist who shot down everything that moved.
  </p>
<p>The girls could barely stand being in the home, as it was so full of dead
stuff.&nbsp; The park ranger told us that at least once a year someone stormed
back into the visitor's center demanding their money back because they were so disgusted.
  </p>
<p>This is the house from the outside.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4235a_img.jpg" width="480" height="640">
  </p>
  <p>This phrase was over the door lintel.&nbsp; None of us recall what it
  means.&nbsp; It was something like &quot;You reap what you plant&quot;. Any
  Latin speakers out there?
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4233a_img.jpg" width="491" height="147">
  </p>
  <p>And then we drove South, off Long Island, into rush hour traffic at 4:00
  PM.&nbsp; It may sound insane to intentionally take a 43 foot 10,000 pound rig
  into the menacing New York rush hour traffic, but either I am getting inured
  to such, or it was better than average.&nbsp; At any rate, it took us only 6
  hours or so to get down to Annapolis, and I did not have apoplexy en route.
