  <p>As I mentioned earlier, we were in desperate need of a laundry.&nbsp; Since
  none was forthcoming, the ladies washed out their delicates in the sink, and
  hung them out to dry on the line out behind the trailer.
  </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2231_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The trailer had not been washed by me.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; After 12 weeks and
9,800 miles, it seemed time.&nbsp; It took only an hour or so, and I used only a
few gallons of water.&nbsp; Washing made a huge difference in the appearance of the
beast, so much so that I washed the van, too, as it had not been washed since
Georgia.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2232_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>The weather had been slowly warming over the past days, to the point where
this day looked to be warm enough for a venture out the the Atlantic side of the
island -- a beach trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We biked North along US&nbsp; 12 to where it cut over to the Atlantic via a
mile-long smooth dirt and shell road through the marshland.&nbsp; There wee numerous shore birds nesting
there all along the marshy and brackish inlets, feasting on minnows and
pollywogs.&nbsp; The blue heron below let me get&nbsp;about 4 feet away.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2236a_IMG.JPG" width="398" height="482"></p>
<p>Once at the beach, we had it nearly to ourselves -- just the way we like
it.&nbsp; It was warm enough for bathing suits and swimming, but just barely on
both counts.&nbsp; The wind was still blowing pretty hard, so we hid behind a
sand dune, and it was lovely.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2244_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The young ladies enjoyed a &quot;beach day&quot; very much.&nbsp; Joya and
Jordan had somehow managed to forget to bring along suits, so they swam and
sunned in their small clothes.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2246_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Another Joya shot, also processed.&nbsp; This is of Tessany, and nicely shows
the isolation and beauty of these beaches.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2249a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We had a big day planned.&nbsp; After beaching, we ate a quick dinner and
then headed over to &quot;Ocracoke Adventures&quot;, a kayak and surfing
shop.&nbsp; They offered a full moon kayak tour, departing about 6:30 PM.&nbsp;
Tessany shot the picture below of the 4 Thomases preparing to hit the water.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2264_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After paddling across the harbor, we began exploring the &quot;creeks&quot;,
which were really brackish backwater channels along the sound.&nbsp; Below Joya
is getting herself unstuck from the marsh grasses.&nbsp; Paddling was tough
going across the harbor, since the wind was blowing the backs of our boats
around quite a bit -- we all had to work hard to keep the kayaks pointing in a
semi-straight line.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2267_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Jody and Jordan found a humongous hermit crab on the bottom, and timidly hauled it
out for examination by our guide, Annette.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2272_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After looking for nesting sea birds, we paddled back up another creek 'to see
what we could see'.&nbsp; As you can see from the photo below, it was very near
sunset.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2273_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>One of the things to be seen was this long-dead sea turtle, apparently a
featured attractions during our tour.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2277_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Very near full dark, Joya took this image of me with no flash.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2279_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>We congregated in one corner of a pond while Annette told us of the history
of one Edward Teach, a.k.a. Blackbeard the Pirate.&nbsp; Legend had it that he
often anchored near the spot below, since it afforded easy access to the
shipping lanes while also providing protection from storms.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2281_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We next paddled back up a side channel, by now in full dark, with no moon
risen yet.&nbsp; We finally arrived, guided by Annette, somewhere, and began
following her instructions for hauling ourselves and our boats out of the
water.&nbsp; When Jody asked &quot;Annette, where are we?&quot;, Annette
answered that we were in June Brown's backyard -- which is what it looked
like.&nbsp; June had a small channel running along the back of her
property.&nbsp; We all piled out (there were 15 or so of us in total), and walked up
the road a piece.&nbsp; Soon we arrived at an open pickup truck with double
bench seats over the wheel wells.&nbsp; This was the 'shuttle' back to the kayak
shop.&nbsp; As we had come to really like this little island, we had begun
quizzing the islanders about life here.&nbsp; We really like Annette, and got to
know her a bit.&nbsp; We also spoke briefly with her boss, Mike, who now waves
to us whenever we pass by on our bikes.</p>
<p>Very wet and a bit cold, we pedaled back to Teeter's and our trailer.&nbsp; I
was on dish and tea duty, while the ladies all showered to warm themselves and
get into pajamas.&nbsp; We had our usual cards-and-tea-and-cookies, and then hit
the sack.</p>
