<p>Below is our Amazing Traveling Entomology Exhibit, which we sometimes use as
our car.&nbsp; After 24,000 miles of travel through 44 states and Canadian
Provinces, we have carefully collected species from all over North
America.&nbsp; We have not washed it since May, while on Ocracoke, in order to
preserve the high quality and diversity of the exhibit.&nbsp; We have
quite a collection embedded in the radiator grill -- perhaps we will donate the
van to the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History when we return.</p>

<p>One evening, Jordan and I caught up on our pool while Jody visited with her
brother.&nbsp; We played a new game: &quot;Eyes Closed Any-ball&quot;.&nbsp; This
way the games lasted quite a while, maximizing our fun-factor-per-dollar.&nbsp;
It was OK to have eyes open while lining up the shot, but you had to hit the
ball with closed eyes.&nbsp; We also took several hot tubs, and played 2 full
games of &quot;Hand and Foot&quot;, which Monika had taught to the ladies during
our stay at the cabin in Polebridge.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7228_IMG.JPG" width="328" height="434"><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7227_IMG.JPG" width="327" height="435"></p>
<p>The next day, Adam agreed to be our guide for a walk about the historic Pike
Street Market area.&nbsp; We got started around 9:30, and drove to the Seattle
Space Needle, which has a station for the only municipal monorail system in the
country.&nbsp; Below is the monorail pulling into the station.&nbsp; Those are
the actual colors; the building in the background is Paul Allen's
&quot;Experience Music Project&quot;, of which we did not have time to partake.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7233a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We walked downhill to the Pike Street Market, which is an institution in
Seattle.&nbsp; Hundreds of vendors selling all sorts of flowers, produce, fish,
meats and jewelry set up their wares bright and early each
morning.&nbsp; We walked about, and sampled some of their offerings.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7242_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We discovered one produce stand with these beautiful, incredibly huge
apples.&nbsp; We bought the one pictured below, and it fed all four of us.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7243_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/expeditn/exphorsa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p>We next dashed across town to catch the 1:00 PM &quot;Underground
Tour&quot;.&nbsp; We made it by the skin of our teeth.&nbsp; The tour starts
above ground, with a quick history of Seattle.&nbsp; A considerable part of that
history was driven by one Thomas Crapper, who invented the flush toilet.&nbsp;
You see, Seattle had been mostly built at the water line, often on 'fill'.&nbsp;
Fill was anything they could throw into the water to make more buildable
land.&nbsp; This was often sawdust, which had to unfortunate tendency to decay,
causing potholes so large that they formed deep and dangerous pools.&nbsp; A
child even fell into one such 'pothole', and drowned.&nbsp; But I digress; the
main problem were the flush toilets installed very near the water line.&nbsp; At
high tide, these toilets ran backwards, spewing fountains of sewage.&nbsp; The
patient residents lived with this situation for 8 years, when providence
intervened: Seattle burned to the ground.&nbsp; Rather than assuming that this
was a godly indictment of their ways, civic leaders took this as a more positive
sign, and wisely took action: they moved the entire district straight upward,
abandoning the ground floor of the fledgling city.&nbsp; This abandoned first
floor was the subject of
our tour.</p>
<p>Below is one of the offending -- offensive? -- toilets, located about 10 feet
below the current city's ground level.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7245a_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>Above ground, I took this shot of one of the historic buildings.&nbsp; In
front on the sidewalk, when the city was elevated, they built in some beautiful
colored glass containing manganese...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7256a_IMG.JPG" width="509" height="626"></p>
<p>...which you can see here, from below.&nbsp; Often, the tour took place along
the original sidewalks, now completely underground and largely unused.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7249_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The tour took us through some pretty grimy spaces.&nbsp; This highly
processed photo, taken in natural light under the city, gives you some idea of
what the passages looked like.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7246a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Jody, passing through a retaining wall.&nbsp; Each intersection was walled
off to prevent the underground spread of fire.&nbsp; The tour operators were
able to open passageways through some of these.</p>

<p>After the tour and a quick lunch courtesy of Adam, we continued our
exploration of the waterfront area.&nbsp; Adam directed us into a bizarre store
that was half tourist T-shirt shop and half old time amusement gallery.&nbsp; We
poked nickels and quarters into the old machines, included &quot;Laughing
Jack&quot;, on the left.&nbsp; At right, Jordan poses with a smile mask.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7259_IMG.JPG" width="360" height="480"><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7260_IMG.JPG" width="360" height="480"></p>
<p>We bought flowers to give to Chris and Jennifer, with whom we were to have
dinner that evening.&nbsp; Jordan bought her own bouquet, as well.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7261a_IMG.JPG" width="488" height="382"></p>
<p>We said our goodbyes to Adam, and then Jody, Jordan and I walked South along
the waterfront to the ferry landing, where we just missed the 4:40 ferry.&nbsp;
Oh well...</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/expeditn/exphorsa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p>Chris Mosio and Jennifer Louden are friends from Santa Barbara who up and
moved themselves to Bainbridge Island in the Puget Sound this past summer.&nbsp;
Bainbridge is a quiet, wooded island where residents cherish their watery
isolation from the mainland.&nbsp; Only a 30 minute ferry ride from downtown
Seattle, it is no wonder the Louden/Mosio family chose to settle there.</p>
<p>Below are Chris and Jennifer.&nbsp; Jennifer has an acutely sharp instinct
for closing her eyes when photos are taken -- this was the only way we could get
a shot of her baby-blues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7268_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The Louden/Mosio family generously made a lovely dinner for us, followed by
pie and ice cream.&nbsp; Below, Lillian, who is Chris and Jennifer's only child,
enjoy seconds of ice cream along with Jordan.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7271a_IMG.JPG" width="628" height="372"></p>
<p>A group shot of our little gathering.&nbsp; We had only this one night visit with them -- far too short.&nbsp; However, we were aiming to be back in
Santa Barbara before Halloween, so this was all the time we had.&nbsp; It was
really, really good to see them again.&nbsp; We had missed them greatly.&nbsp;
We expect to see them in Santa Barbara next; after all, we traveled last to
visit them, right?</p>
