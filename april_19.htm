Asheville is only a short distance from the Great Smokey Mountains and Cherokee
country, and we wanted to see some of it, so off we went on a day trip,
departing about 9 AM.&nbsp; The drive was fabulous -- uphill, further into the
Appalachians, until they become the Smokies, so named for the layer of blue haze
that often hangs between the peaks.&nbsp; During the highest parts of the drive,
spring had not yet arrived -- the trees were bare of leaves, and there was still
snow on the ground in spots.&nbsp; This gave us pause, as we had been planning
on backpacking in the Smokies in the next week or two.
<p>The small town of Cherokee sits on the Cherokee Indian reservation directly
south of Great Smokey Mountain National Park. Most of the town was devoted
to the tourist industry, with way too many Indian-themed souvenir shops selling rubber
tomahawks.&nbsp; Also featured were run-down motels and diners, and pathetic places that advertised that
you could 'feed the baby bears'.&nbsp; We ignored all of that junk.&nbsp;
Fortunately, there is an excellent living history museum there, re-enacting a
Cherokee village; however, it did not open for several more weeks, so we went
just to the Museum of the Cherokee.&nbsp; This was highly informative, telling
the story of the Cherokee peoples from their pre-history around 10,000 years
ago, up to the present day.&nbsp; Cherokee staffed the museum, and I was
surprised by their speaking accent.&nbsp; In Navajo country, the Navajo we met
all had accents, resulting from the fact that their first language had been
Navajo -- English was learned much later, in school.&nbsp; In Cherokee, I
expected some kind of native-flavored dialect, similar to what we had
encountered in Navajo lands.&nbsp; However, all the Cherokee I heard speak had
rather strong&nbsp; Carolina upcountry accents (a type of Southern
accent).&nbsp; It was incongruous.</p>
<p>After our brief tour, we raced back to camp -- we were not staying there that
night, and needed to pack up and move on, which is what we did.&nbsp; We were
planning on meeting up with my brother Scott's wife and kids the next day.&nbsp;
They were coincidentally visiting her sister Karen in Advance, due South of Winston-Salem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drive East across Western North Carolina was again wondrous -- this is a
beautiful state, full of woods and seemingly sparsely populated.&nbsp; Much of
the state is rolling hills or mountains -- the 'upcountry'.&nbsp; We did have
some trouble getting ourselves into an RV park.&nbsp; Our park of choice never
answered their phone, but this often meant nothing more than that no one was in
the office all day, which is common when things are not too busy.&nbsp; When we
pulled up, we found that the campground was closed.&nbsp; We searched our
park-finding resources, and found another park 10 or 15 miles away, taking the
precaution this time of calling ahead.&nbsp; This was a &quot;Thousand
Trails&quot; membership campground, but the gentleman we reached assured us that
we could stay there that night for $20, and that they had room.&nbsp; When we
arrived at the gate of the park just before dusk, a polite portly lady inquired
if we were members.&nbsp; We said no.&nbsp; Were we guests of members, or did we
otherwise have an appointment?&nbsp; No, we did not.&nbsp; &quot;Well, then, you
can't camp here&quot;.&nbsp; Puzzled, we explained the conversation we had just
had with someone there.&nbsp; Of course, this gentleman was no where to be
found, but they at least acknowledged that they knew who he was based on my
description of his voice.&nbsp; The portly lady said she would have to get
&quot;the park ranger&quot;.&nbsp; When he arrived, he was very sympathetic, but firm: this was a
membership campground.&nbsp; No one but members or guests could camp,
period.&nbsp; Given our sad circumstances (it was approaching full dark now), he
was willing to let us pay the $20 and camp that night as &quot;guests of
membership sales&quot;, but we would have to sit through a sales pitch the next
day, where some pimply college kid or greasy sales guy in a wide tie would try to
sell us a membership in the park.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I'd (this is Doug
talking) rather have
someone hit me on the head with a medium large stick -- several times.&nbsp; So,
we left.</p>
<p>Lake Myers&nbsp; RV Park was about 15 miles from there.&nbsp; It was now full
dark, well after 8 PM, so we did not even try to call.&nbsp; When we got there,
we did find someone in a side office -- Mr. Myers himself.&nbsp; He jovially
welcomed us, and told us to just go ahead and find a site and set up, and
register in the morning.&nbsp; A bit easier said than done, but done it
was.&nbsp; Lake Myers RV park was nearly full with parked-but-empty RVs.&nbsp;
In other words, most of the sites were full, but their occupants were weekenders
or seasonal, and not currently there.&nbsp; Kind of like an RV ghost town.&nbsp;
Not at all unpleasant, though.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We got set up, called Kristin, made some dinner, and wearily hit the sack.</p>
