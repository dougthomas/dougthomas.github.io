<p>We drove all day from Yellowstone, westward into Montana, up to Whitefish,
which lies just West of Glacier National Park in the upper left-hand corner of
Montana.&nbsp; Our dear friends Joseph, Monika and Max Puglielli (pronounced
poo-yee-ell-ee) live there, up in the mountains of the wild West.&nbsp; They
have 5 wooded acres and a lovely home, pictured below.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/12/172-7217a_IMG.JPG" width="680" height="331">
<p>Shortly after arriving the first order of business was for Monika and Jordan
to make Max's birthday cake.&nbsp; It was Max's birthday on the 27th, and he was
going to get a Tigger cake.&nbsp; They worked hard on the decorations that
evening until late into the night, at which time we all enjoyed a campfire
outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Puglielli's first-born is this wondrous, patient, intelligent dog named Jasmine.&nbsp; Below, she
demonstrates one of her many tricks, which she allowed me to direct her
in.&nbsp; Here, she waits until commanded to eat the treat on her nose.</p>

Joseph and Monika had rented a Forest Service cabin about an hour North of their
home.&nbsp; We departed for it around 2:00 PM the next day, not really knowing
what to expect.
</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/expeditn/exphorsa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p>The cabin is located up 40 miles of dirt road, near the charming little
settlement of Polebridge, only 30 miles from the Canadian border and immediately
adjacent to Glacier National Park and the North fork of the Flathead
river.&nbsp; Polebridge consists of the Polebridge Mercantile, a venerable
general store established in the early part of the 20th century, and the
Northern Lights Cafe, an intimate restaurant serving up tasty mountain
fare.&nbsp; That's it, besides the local resident population inhabiting the
surrounding hills.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7211a_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="421"></p>
<p>Our cabin was a wonder to behold.&nbsp; With 4 bedrooms, it slept 8
easily.&nbsp; It was heated with a hefty wood burning stove situated in the
living room, and lighting was provided by propane lamps mounted on the walls and
ceiling -- no electricity or running water, although it had a complete
kitchen.&nbsp; We were smitten.&nbsp; The ladies were not exactly pleased to
find that the only toilet facility was a pit toilet located a short walk from
the back door of the cabin, but we all made do.</p>
<p>Below is a shot of the exterior, taken from the river.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7203a_IMG.JPG" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/12/171-7162a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The opposite view, back towards the kitchen.&nbsp; The decor was decidedly
mountain-country-kitsch.&nbsp; We loved it.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/171-7166a_IMG.JPG" width="647" height="507"></p>
<p>With no indoor plumbing, we had to pump water from the well by hand.&nbsp;
Below, I am pumping a pot full of dish water to be heated up on the propane
stove.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/12/171-7154a_IMG.JPG" width="608" height="731">
<p>Joseph and Max enjoying a spell in our hammock.&nbsp; You can see the aspens
in the background -- they were everywhere, turning colors of yellow and gold.</p>

<img border="0" src="images/12/171-7159a_IMG.JPG" width="313" height="374"></p>
<p>Joseph and I took a bike ride up to Bowman Lake, about 7 miles up an even
more bumpy dirt road, straight East into Glacier Park.&nbsp; We never made it
all the way to the lake itself, but the ride was marvelous.&nbsp; The young
aspens were screaming out their colors from among the charred trunks of trees
burned in a fire in 1988.</p>

<p>On the left, Max in motion.&nbsp; We were walking to 'downtown' Polebridge to
dine one night at the Northern Lights Cafe.&nbsp; We were surprised when we got
there to find that it was packed -- all the tables were full, as was the
bar.&nbsp; It was a bit of a mystery where all the people came from, but this
was Friday night, after all. We walked next door to check out the 'merc', as it
is known locally, and waited until we saw some folks leave.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/171-7173a_IMG.JPG" width="265" height="494"> <img border="0" src="images/12/171-7178a_IMG.JPG" width="432" height="492"></p>
<p>Here we are inside.&nbsp; Electricity was scare here -- batteries or
generators were required.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/171-7179a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>A group shot at dinner, taken by Jordan.&nbsp; Those are my and Joseph's hats
hanging from the antlers.&nbsp; The meal was excellent -- they had 2 or 3
vegetarian entree options, and 2 excellent microbrews on draft.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/171-7181a_IMG.JPG" width="684" height="724"></p>
<p>The walk back to the cabin in the moonlight was enchanting, although we did
have to keep our eyes peeled for grizzly.&nbsp; Joseph and I both carried 'bear
spray' with us, which is essentially tear gas that can be delivered in a stream.</p>
<p>The next day we all piled into Joseph's truck for the bumpy ride to Bowman
lake, pictured below.&nbsp; You can click on the photo to see a more detailed
view of this shot, if you like.</p>

<p>After a short hike around the West side of the lake, Jordan and Max waded
into the frosty, crystal clear water.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/171-7194_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The full moon rising over the hills.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/12/172-7210a_IMG.JPG" width="575" height="573"></p>
<p>We spent 4 delightful neo-luddite days at the cabin with the Puglielli's.&nbsp;
Really fun.</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/expeditn/exphorsa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p><br>
We were reluctant to leave the Puglielli's, so we got an even later start on the
next day's drive than normal: 2:30 or so.&nbsp; That, coupled with an emergency run
to Costco to purchase playing cards, meant that even getting out of Montana this
day was not going to happen.</p>
<p>We drove until 6:30 or so, and stopped for the night in St. Regis en route to
Seattle.</p>
