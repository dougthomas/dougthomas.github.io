</blockquote>
<p>We climbed into the car around 11 -- early for us -- and drove South, back
into Montreal, armed with some basic parking information we had obtained from
our campground owners.&nbsp; We listened to the radio during the drive, enjoying
the sound of the the French-speaking DJ.&nbsp; One of the first things we learned about&nbsp; Montreal was that it was pronounced
&quot;mon ray all&quot; by the locals, as in Mount Regal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not pay close enough attention to Jody's driving
directions, and we nearly ended up back in Quebec.&nbsp; Just in the nick of
time, Jody got me off the freeway, and she guided us through city streets to our
intended parking lot.&nbsp; The drive across town was wonderful -- right through
one of the University sections of town, so the neighborhoods had a very lively, intriguing
feel to them -- so much so that we walked back there later that day, from
&quot;Old Montreal&quot; where we parked.</p>
<p>Fabulous architecture.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6158a_IMG.JPG" width="627" height="722"></p>
<p>This is a shot of the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; -- City Hall for you
non-French speakers.&nbsp; This was a grand, imposing building, with the French
architectural influences very apparent.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6159m_IMG.JPG" width="632" height="432"></p>
<p>By the time we had all gotten parked and walked about a bit, it was lunch
time.&nbsp; We found an interesting Mexican restaurant with a menu that appealed
to all of us.</p>
<p>Here we are, eating outside.&nbsp; The weather in Canada had been marvelous,
mostly in the 70s to 80s, with very little rain.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6185_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After lunch, we walked through some of Old Montreal, towards the Notre Dame
Basilica there.&nbsp; Here is a shot of it as we approached.&nbsp; Note the
high-rise office tower just visible in the background.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6186a_IMG.JPG" width="550" height="451"></p>
<p>We got to the church at about 2:15 PM.&nbsp; At 2:30 there was a combination
tour and concert that we wanted to catch, so we hung out on the steps and
waited.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6188_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The interior of the church was ridiculously ornate; almost disturbingly so,
but nonetheless beautiful in its way.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6192_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>There was a gigantic pipe organ installed with 7,500 pipes which ranged in
size from 1/4 inch to 32 feet.&nbsp; You can see some of the larger ones in this
shot.&nbsp; For scale, note the chairs at the bottom of the picture.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6198_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>We sat in those chairs for a short lecture on the history of the church,
given by a charming native with a pleasant French accent.&nbsp; He injected
quite a bit of humor into his spiel, which he did not just rattle off, but
rather told us in a conversational manner.</p>
<p>After the tour, we proceeded to the Vestry, where a quintet sang medieval
music accompanied by a small pump organ.&nbsp; Pope John Paul visited this
church in the 80s -- you can see his photograph in the background below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/161-6200a_IMG.JPG" width="577" height="502"></p>
<p>After the church, we left the old section of the city and walked into the
collegiate neighborhood we had seen earlier -- called &quot;The Latin
Quarter&quot; for reasons unknown to us.&nbsp; At various times throughout the
day, we saw very oddly dressed young people doing very odd things, as if they
were all on some kind of gigantic, University-wide scavenger hunt.&nbsp; Below
is one such group.&nbsp; They rendering a spirited version of The Village
People's &quot;YMCA&quot; in French.&nbsp; We never did find out what they were
all doing.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/162-6204a_IMG.JPG" width="593" height="347"></p>
<p>Another architecture shot.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/162-6206_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>That evening near sunset, we walked back to Old Montreal, where a topiary
exhibit of humongous proportions was taking place called &quot;Le Jardin des
Magiciens&quot;.&nbsp; These were probably not 'true' topiaries, since the
plants were growing on metal structures.&nbsp; Think of more like a living,
stationary Rose Parade.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/162-6219a_IMG.JPG" width="447" height="185"></p>
<p>Here are some highlights from our 2 hour stroll.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/162-6212_IMG.JPG" width="360" height="480"></p>
<p>These ducks were a favorite.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/162-6215a_IMG.JPG" width="616" height="272"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/162-6217_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>This was a representation of the Aboriginal &quot;rock people&quot; sculptures
-- Inukshuk-- that still dot the wilder Northern landscapes.&nbsp; These rock
people act as markers to guide travelers, and to help heard caribou,&nbsp; among
other purposes.</p>

<p>The girls enjoying the pseudo-pictogram.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/7/162-6265a_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>And last but far from least: we had seen lots of people zooming by the
waterfront on small electric scooters.&nbsp; Jordan has wanted to ride one of
these things for months -- maybe even years.&nbsp; We found the place that
rented them, and after a 30 minute wait, the girls set off to explore.&nbsp;
They had an absolute blast, zooming along at 30 or so miles per hour.&nbsp; When
they slowed down enough, we caught these images of them.</p>

<p>A really grand day in a grand city.</p>
