<p>Driving ever Northeast, we finally came to...
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/6/156-5664A_IMG.JPG" width="291" height="126">
  </p>
<p>Where we had to clear Canadian customs.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/6/156-5668a_IMG.JPG" width="152" height="121" align="left">&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/6/156-5669a_IMG.JPG" width="172" height="121">&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/6/156-5668b_IMG.JPG" width="123" height="121"><p align="left">The
nice customs lady asked all kinds of questions about what we were bringing in to
Canada. When I said that we did not have any alcohol, dairy, or meat, she looked
a bit askance at us, since we were after all towing a pretty large trailer, with
fridge.&nbsp; But she let it pass. When she asked if we had any pepper spray
with us, I answered &quot;I don't think so&quot;, with which she was
understandably not satisfied -- she wanted a 'yes' or 'no'.&nbsp; I had given
Jody a small pepper spray for Christmas a few years ago.&nbsp; We vaguely
recalled that it may be in the glove box, and after rummaging about a bit we
produced it.&nbsp; The nice customs lady then told us to park, and take a form
she gave us, along with the spray, over to the customs house.</p>
<p align="left">Once inside, I had to sign a form acknowledging that I was
&quot;surrendering my personal property to the crown&quot; of England.&nbsp;
This was a fun and unusual experience; I had never been asked to surrender
anything to the crown before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The offending spray sitting on the counter, now the property of
Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; I hope she enjoys it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/156-5675_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>After clearing customs and changing money into Canadian dollars, we
discovered a new time zone, called &quot;Atlantic Time&quot;, and that we were
now in it.&nbsp; We thought that Eastern Time was the last time zone covering a
populated area until you hit the British Isles.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; There are at
least 2 other time zones East of Eastern Time.&nbsp; At any rate, we were now 4
hours ahead of our hometown Pacific Time.</p>
<p>And so we drove
North and East, nearly up to the tip of the Bay of Fundy.</p>
<p>Tides at Fundy are typically monstrous.&nbsp; A 40 vertical foot tide is not
uncommon at all.&nbsp; Apparently the shape and orientation of the bay are just
perfect to reflect back and forth a standing wave of water that moves up and down
the bay.&nbsp; Imagine that you are sitting in your bathtub, and you suddenly move
forward.&nbsp; A large wave moves away from you, bounces off the far end of the
tub, and returns to you, all in the space of a few seconds.&nbsp; If you then
move forward again, if you time it right, you can push the wave higher, and as all children learn, you
can even make a wave big enough that it overflows the bathtub.&nbsp; Now imagine
that your tub is hundreds of miles long, and that the period of the standing
wave is 13 hours or so.&nbsp; The 'push forward' is provided by the incoming
tide, which reinforces the 'old' wave.&nbsp; And so you get something like Fundy,
apparently the only place in the world like it.&nbsp; Quite amazing, as you will
hopefully will see.</p>
<p>Below is a 'before' picture, taken of a small inlet at low tide.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/156-5681M_IMG.JPG" width="689" height="203"></p>
<p>And here is the same inlet at high tide.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/157-5711M_IMG.JPG" width="681" height="212"></p>
<p>While the tide was coming up, Jody and I stood still, about 5 feet from the
waterline, and waited.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/156-5684a_IMG.JPG" width="572" height="270"></p>
<p>Within a few minutes, our toes were under water.&nbsp; The water rises here
about 1 vertical inch per minute as the tide comes in.&nbsp; On a fairly flat
beach like this one, 2 or 3 yards of horizontal beach per minute rejoined the
bay.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/156-5685a_IMG.JPG" width="592" height="302"></p>
<p>We just stood and watched the tide come in for an hour or more.&nbsp; In the
picture below, Joya had put a mark on her leg, at about mid calf.&nbsp; We stood
and waited in ankle-deep water, and timed the rise until the water covered the
mark.&nbsp; It took about 8 minutes.&nbsp; We later measured, and it the
distance from ankle to mark was indeed 8 inches or so.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/156-5689_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Another before and after series, this time of the harbor at the small town of
Alma.&nbsp; The boats below are just sitting on the mud.&nbsp; Those are the
docks behind them.&nbsp; Fishermen time their departures and arrivals to match
the high tide, which only occurs twice per day.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/157-5702_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>You can see that the tide comes in even higher at times, based on the height
of the docks.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/157-5721_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The rocks below, located on Hopewell Cape just North of Fundy National Park, are called &quot;flowerpot rocks&quot; for obvious
reasons.&nbsp; At low tide, these are just sitting in the sand.&nbsp; At high
tide, the small caves at the bottom are covered by water.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/157-5709_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/6/157-5710_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The girls found a paradise for rock-skipping.</p>
