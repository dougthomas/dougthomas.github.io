<p>We left D.C. and headed North, into Amish country, specifically Lancaster
County which has about 1300 Amish farms and 22,000 or so Amish and Mennonite
residents.&nbsp; Old order Amish do not own or drive cars; they dress according
to a fairly rigid code of dress, and plow their fields using teams of horses or
mules.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are very polite, nice, intelligent people who keep to
themselves as part of their church doctrine -- they purposely avoid 'worldly'
pursuits and those that pursue them.&nbsp; What little contact we had we enjoyed
muchly.</p>
<p>This is the view from our campsite's 'front yard'.&nbsp; The town of
Intercourse (once called &quot;Cross Keys&quot;) is almost entirely a farm
town.&nbsp; Intercourse apparently once meant &quot;a crossing of
roads&quot;.&nbsp; Our campground had farms on 3 sides, including the one in the
background.&nbsp; The predominant scent, from our site, was of eau de cow.&nbsp;
It was overwhelming, initially.&nbsp; We gradually became used to the smell and
didn't notice it after a day or two.&nbsp;</p>
<img border="0" src="images/1/135-3571_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
<p>I actually cooked part of dinner for this first night in Amish country --
only the 2nd time I have done so on this entire trip.&nbsp; I do, however, wash
a lot of dishes.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3585_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>Jordan and Jody enjoy the sunset from our campsite, surrounded by Amish
farms.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3587_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The day after our arrival, we had a lot of questions about who the Amish
were, and why they lived as they did, so we started off with a tour of a
reproduction Amish farmhouse, followed by an odd little film called 'The Amish
Experience' in &quot;F/X Theater&quot;.&nbsp; The farmhouse tour was good, and
the tour guide very knowledgeable.&nbsp; This helped a lot; &quot;F/X
Theater&quot; was touted as very unique, one of only 3 such theaters in the
U.S.&nbsp; We now understand why there are only 3 -- the film and effects were
that cheesy.&nbsp; However, it did give us one more important bit of information
about the Amish: Amish teenagers are not baptized at birth.&nbsp; Youth must
choose to join the Amish church, and they typically do so in their late teens --
but there is no time limit.&nbsp; If they choose not to join the church, they
may still have dinner with their parents from time to time, but they may have no
other contact with any other Amish.&nbsp; They become 'English', which is the
name the Amish give to all non-Amish, and are shunned.&nbsp; We discussed this idea, and all of
us liked the idea of adult choice.&nbsp; Apparently about 90% of Amish teens choose to be
baptized into the Amish church.</p>
<p>Part of the farmhouse tour included the items of clothing in the photos
below, all hand made.&nbsp; Boys clothes are on the left, and girls on the
right.&nbsp; The only personal choices that can be made is the color of the
shirts for boys or men, and the color of the dress for girls or women.&nbsp; The
cloth is always cut the same, and all the black you see never changes.&nbsp; The
wife/mother of the family typically makes all of the clothes -- out of polyester
so that they are durable and don't need ironing.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3594_IMG.JPG" width="332" height="250"><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3599_IMG.JPG" width="333" height="250">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boy's and men's headwear: black hats with brims less than 4 inches for all
months except for summer.&nbsp; Straw is used in summer.&nbsp; Brims 4 inches or
over are reserved for the bishop.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3600_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The Amish do not wish to be photographed, although when or if asked they may
agree to be.&nbsp; So we were rather circumspect in taking the few pictures we
have, from a distance only, and never of faces.</p>
<p>This sight was everywhere, preceded by the rapid rhythmic clop-clop clop-clop
of the horses hooves.&nbsp; The practical single day range for such a rig was
commonly thought to be 25 miles.&nbsp; For longer trips, Amish will either take
the train, or hire an 'English' to take them.&nbsp; This has spawned a small
industry of retirees in the area who hire themselves out to be periodic drivers
for the Amish.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/136-3604a_IMG.JPG" width="342" height="313"></p>
<p>This country is hypnotically beautiful and peaceful, even though virtually
all of it is under cultivation.&nbsp; And, apparently, the Amish don't use
pesticides and have continued to farm as their ancestors did.&nbsp; It feels very safe and tranquil.&nbsp; It
is as if the Amish's presence here for 300 or so years has ebbed into the very
soil, infusing it with their values and spirit.&nbsp; It is very odd, but all of
us felt this, and, whatever it is, I think it contributes to why people return
here to be tourists in Amish country.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/136-3606a_IMG.JPG" width="605" height="126"></p>
<p>We would often take drives, ambling through the countryside, and would come
across scenes like the one below.&nbsp; The image is somewhat hard to discern: a
woman is sitting on top of a horse-drawn plow, working her way down the rows.</p>

This odd picture was taken by Jordan.&nbsp; That is me, in the middle of a small
field, watching fireflies.&nbsp; The neat thing about this shot is that she
captured a firefly while it was lit; that is the small bright spec you see above
my head.&nbsp; It was really magical.&nbsp;&nbsp; We just hung out in this
field, watched fireflies, and listened to an Amish 'Hymn Sing' at a nearby
farmhouse.&nbsp; Prior to my joining them, Jody and Jordan had sat in a wooden
swing doing the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to catch one of the fireflies in my hand.&nbsp; They look a little
like elongated lady bugs.&nbsp; He would not light while I held him, so I let
him go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we were in Williamsburg, we met a delightful family that we ran across
several times during our week there: the Etzweilers.&nbsp; During one visit with
them they asked us where we were bound, and when we replied that we would be up
in Amish country in a week or two, they offered to have us to dinner at their
home, as they lived in Lancaster.&nbsp; So, we took them up on their generous
offer, and met them on a Saturday.&nbsp; They offered to be our tour guides for
Lancaster (city), so off we went to the first pretzel factory in the USA -- the
Sturgis Pretzel factory in Lititz.&nbsp; For $2 each, we got a quick spiel
covering the history of this bakery, including a lesson in how to twist a
pretzel prior to baking.&nbsp; Of course, eating fresh-baked soft pretzels was
part of the experience (although we had to pay extra -- 3 pretzels for a
dollar).</p>
<p>Below from left to right: Dale, Ellen, Tara, Natalie, Jordan, Joya and
me.&nbsp; Missing from this picture were Jody, who shot the photo, and the
Etzweiler's oldest daughter, Abby, who was working during much of our visit.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/136-3628a_IMG.JPG" width="486" height="422"></p>
<p>After pretzels, we saw the Lancaster railway station -- a lovely old stone
building in the tradition of European rail stations --&nbsp; and some of the
historic buildings of this fine town.&nbsp; The home pictured below was
renovated from a dilapidated state to its current over-the-top glory.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/136-3632_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>That evening just before sunset, the young ladies all frolicked in the
cornfield behind the Etzweiler home.&nbsp; A family of fox were known to stalk
about this field, but we did not see them during our visits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/136-3637_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Jody and I picked them up the next day, Sunday, and took this one last shot
of the Etzweilers.&nbsp; It was really a treat to get to spend time with
them.&nbsp; Our families were remarkably compatible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After we left, we talked about how generous they were with us and with their
time -- we occupied their entire weekend, and they were remarkably gracious
hosts, feeding us almost continuously.&nbsp; We were invited to dinner,
initially, and didn't mention our dietary handicap.&nbsp; The Etzweilers had
planned to have ribs on the BBQ.&nbsp; When we sprung it on them that we
couldn't join them in the meatfest, they graciously changed the menu.&nbsp; On
our way home from touring the city, we stopped at the grocery store where we
aquired a good number of things the Etzweilers had never tasted before.&nbsp;
They were so willing to try new things!&nbsp; We brought home mangoes, avocados,
and cilantro.&nbsp; We ate out on their deck, at sunset, and spent a lovely
evening getting to know each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/136-3639_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>The next day, Monday, as we were leaving Intercourse, we took back roads,
hunting for small Amish children selling strawberries from a wagon by the
roadside.&nbsp; We had found such before.&nbsp; This time, we found the wagon
and berries, but no children were in evidence -- they were for sale for $1 per
quart, on the honor system.&nbsp; Put the money in the can, and take your
berries.&nbsp; We wanted 2 quarts, but were having trouble finding exact change;
we were looking in seat cushions, in the bottom of purses, etc., and only came
up with one dollar and some change.&nbsp; We were parked in front of their home
for so long that the couple who owned the place came out.&nbsp; When Jody
approached them and explained that we did not have exact change, they insisted
that we simply take the 2 quarts -- for free.&nbsp; They had been picked that
morning, and needed to be eaten soon or they would spoil.&nbsp; When Jody
protested, the wife said &quot;my husband has said: no money&quot;.&nbsp; And
for her, that clearly closed the issue entirely.&nbsp; We thanked them
profusely, and talked about our time here as we nibbled strawberries on the
drive West.&nbsp;</p>
