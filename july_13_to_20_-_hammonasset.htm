</blockquote>
<p>After departing New York, we originally were looking for a place to roost in
Connecticut for only a night or two.&nbsp; However, we had been so busy, and
Kevin's induction so emotional, that we literally needed a vacation from our
vacation.&nbsp; So we took it at Hammonasset State Park, on the Long Island
Sound in South-central Connecticut.&nbsp; Hammonasset appears to be this state's
well kept secret -- mostly it was full of natives who had been coming here for
years, often since childhood, and understandably so.&nbsp; It was tranquil beach camping at its near
best.&nbsp; Since there were no hookups of any kind, it discouraged the gigantic
motor home set we often encountered.&nbsp; At over 500 campsites, it is huge --
but it is incredibly kid-friendly, and there were a lot of them to be friendly
with, so it was very good for the girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kids on skateboards,
scooters, roller blades, pogo sticks -- everything that rolled or bounced.&nbsp;
Even kids on motorized scooters called &quot;Mosquitoes&quot;, or on
mopeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aiding this rolling frenzy was the fact that the roads were
all extremely smooth, and the rangers did not really care what anyone did inside
the park.&nbsp; It was kid-heaven.<p>The weather was perfect -- Connecticut was
having unseasonably cool temperatures, down in the 70s and 80s -- and sunny
nearly every afternoon, with occasional showers.&nbsp; Perhaps you can
understand why our original 1 night stay turned into a total of 8 nights...<p>Jody or I snapped this one
night shortly after sunset.
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4817a_IMG.JPG" width="588" height="684"><p>Fires were allowed, but
we had no kindling and it had rained on our wood.&nbsp; So, I made kindling --
without a hatchet or axe -- by splitting some dry wood with a hammer and cold
chisel.&nbsp; Everyone (but me) thought this was fascinating and camera-worthy,
so this Kodak moment is now enshrined here for your enjoyment as well.&nbsp; Let
me know what you think.
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4836_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"><br>
<p>One gimmick that State Parks seem to pull quite a lot is to allow fires, but
fail to include fire pits or rings with the campsite -- they must be rented
separately.&nbsp; We foiled them, however, by finding an old wagon and using it as our &quot;fire
pit&quot;.&nbsp; It worked really well, and was quite the conversation piece
when folks strolled by or visited.
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4837_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Evenings we either hung out by the campfire or watched the thrice-weekly
moving offering at &quot;the amphitheater&quot;.&nbsp; We saw &quot;Miss
Congeniality&quot;, and the girls went to see &quot;The Santa Claus&quot; in
celebration of Christmas in July (really).</p>
<p>I even got out my cedar flute and practiced a bit.&nbsp; I must admit that
the flute is much more convenient a campfire-side instrument than is a Cello.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4843_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The ladies of my household had been complaining that my hair was
unruly.&nbsp; I insisted that it was simply &quot;lively&quot;, as Bill Bryson
described his own, but in the end I acceded to a new 'do, featured below.&nbsp;
After a half day of consideration, we all decided we liked it.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4845a_IMG.JPG" width="645" height="627"></p>
<p>The girls went to the beach nearly every day.&nbsp; The water temperature was
around 70, and there were lifeguards every hundred yards or so -- good swimming
conditions!&nbsp; They also managed to get quite brown, even though they did not
lay out in the sun much.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4850a_IMG.JPG" width="657" height="490"></p>
<p>Frisbee was a daily activity.&nbsp; Jordan was getting very good after only a
short time of practicing.&nbsp; She was considerably better than her sister, who
was having some...troubles... but who was also mostly being a good sport about
the whole thing.</p>
<p>The girls made friends with a 15 year old boy named Mike, a Connecticut
local.&nbsp; He seemed very nice, although he was quiet.&nbsp; He accompanied me
and the girls on a meandering scooter ride one afternoon all over the
campground.</p>
<p>Reading was something we all did a lot of that week.&nbsp; I finished a
gigantic book: the 4th volume in the &quot;Otherland&quot; series by Tad
Williams, if you are interested -- highly recommended, if you like
cyberpunk/science fiction.&nbsp; Jody finished reading &quot;The All True
Adventures of Liddy Newton&quot;.&nbsp; Jordan (with some help from Jody)
finished Bill Bryson's &quot;I'm a&nbsp; Stranger Here Myself&quot;.&nbsp; Joya
put about 100 miles on her scooter and started the 2nd book in the &quot;Amazons
and Swallows&quot; series.</p>
<p>Ah, but all good things come to and end.&nbsp; The bloom was a bit off by
about our 7th day there.&nbsp; The girls had heard that the water in Long Island
Sound was frequently polluted by all the petrochemical processing, although we
could not confirm that and there were no obvious signs.&nbsp; Also, a truly
twisted 14 year old heavy smoker/drinker named Erin who said she had multiple
personalities had adopted the girls.&nbsp; She apparently nattered on non-stop
about her various illegal, immoral or self-abusive pursuits, all in desperate
attempts to get some clearly badly needed attention.&nbsp; The girls politely
tolerated her, but she was disturbed, and disturbing.&nbsp; So, after our 8th
night at Hammonasset, we left.&nbsp; Besides, it was Friday, and all of the good
beach camping spots are full across July weekends, including at Hammonasset.</p>
<p>So, follow us now into our next state: <a href="july_20_to_22_-_holly_hill.htm">July 20 to 22 -
Hope Valley, RI</a></p>
