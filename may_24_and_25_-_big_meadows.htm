<p>We were heading into Memorial Day weekend, a time when Americans take a
breather from work, and celebrate the start of the summer season by packing up
their pringles and beer and head off into the woods to do some
camping.&nbsp; In other words, 'they' were competitors for us -- we were all
competing for the same (scarce) number of camping spots.&nbsp; As we generally
figure out where we go on a day-by-day basis and thus rarely make reservations,
this posed a serious problem for us.&nbsp; Jody thought up a
brilliant but evil plan: stay in a state or national park that had
no-reservation camping, and arrive early enough in the week to beat the holiday
campers.&nbsp; So, we went up into Shenandoah National Park, whose southern
border is just North of Waynesboro.&nbsp; While on our way out of
Charlottesville and Monticello, we stopped at a good Organic food store, similar
to Lazy Acres, called Whole Foods.&nbsp; It was about 2:00 PM, and none of us
had eaten since breakfast, so we were shopping hungry.&nbsp; Mistake number
1.&nbsp; Mistake number 2 was letting the girls have their own shopping cart,
which they filled with indispensables like ice cream cones and frozen
waffles.&nbsp; When the damage was finally tallied, we had way too much food to
store in our pantry and fridge, and had ponied up $450.&nbsp; We actually became
somewhat of an attraction there at Whole Foods -- apparently not many families
showed up in line with 2 baskets full of food costing as much as a small used
car.&nbsp; But, we had lots
of really good food, most of it organic (including $19 worth of parmesan cheese
imported from somewhere near Bratislava).</p>
<p>There are 3 campgrounds in the Shenandoah.&nbsp; Our first choice was not
open, and our second choice did not have as pleasant an ambience as we would
have liked, so we went for the third, Big Meadows, arriving near 7 PM.&nbsp; We
found a choice spot and settled in, hunkering down for the long weekend.&nbsp;
When Jody went up to register, she came back with dire news: of the 3
campgrounds, the other 2 were first-come-first-served; this one took reservations, and they were sold out starting Friday.&nbsp; We could stay
for only 2 nights.&nbsp; The bright spot here was that our first choice
campground was to open on Friday, and we were assured that if we waited at the
gates Friday morning, we would get in.&nbsp; To top things off, I broke off one
of the trailer keys inside the lock, and discovered that I either did not bring
or have lost the duplicate set.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>
<p>I consoled myself that night by playing a bit on the cedar flute that Jody
had given me for my birthday.&nbsp; It is a beautiful, haunting instrument that
is wonderously easy to play.&nbsp; During that evening, we had deer just wander
in to our camp, give us a calm looking over, and continue slowly on.&nbsp; We
heard that since there were no natural predators on adult deer here, and no
hunting was ever allowed in this national park, the deer population was about
twice what it really should be.&nbsp; Deer were everywhere, and turned out to be
very helpful to our situation.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/130-3033a_IMG.JPG" width="513" height="469"></p>
<p>Below is a picture of our savior.&nbsp; Jody was walking in the small wood
behind our campsite, and nearly stepped on her.&nbsp; Curled up as she
was, she could have fit on a dinner plate -- that's how small she was.&nbsp; No matter how close we
got, she did not move.&nbsp; She was breathing, and followed us with her eyes,
but refused to move a muscle.&nbsp; Thinking that she might be injured or sick, we reported finding her
to the rangers, who assured us that newborn deer behaved exactly as we
described.&nbsp; The camp host and ranger came over to have a look, and
estimated that she was most likely born that morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/130-3033b_IMG.JPG" width="596" height="373"></p>
<p>She framed our entire day.&nbsp; We waited about for her mom to show up,
which she did periodically -- just to check up on her, but not to nurse.&nbsp; She would get up
and move around a little on her very wobbly legs, and then lay back down, mostly
in the same spot.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/130-3046a_IMG.JPG" width="516" height="217"></p>
<p>Rangers came by all morning to check on her, and we spent most of our time
outside, watching, sometimes chatting with the various visitors who came by.&nbsp; Around midday, the camp host came over to let us know
that, because of a forecast for rain, they had had enough cancellations over the coming weekend to let us stay
until Tuesday.&nbsp; He even gave me a ride to the registration office in his
little golf cart, to insure that we would get one of the newly-available
sites.&nbsp; The prior day we had been 6th on the waiting list; apparently our
care, interest and concern for the wildlife that had been born in our 'backyard'
had propelled us to the top of the list.&nbsp; We gratefully accepted.</p>
The afternoon progressed towards dusk; and then we saw a truly remarkable thing.
There were two of them,
siblings.&nbsp; They nuzzled for a while, frolicked a bit, and then lay down
again, about 4 feet apart.
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/130-3059a_IMG.JPG" width="613" height="371"></p>
<p>Their mother came over and nursed them both for quite a while.&nbsp; Then a
third fawn appeared, and appeared to nurse from the same mom.&nbsp;&nbsp; No
wonder the mom looked so thin, despite the lushness of the setting.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/1/130-3070a_IMG.JPG" width="664" height="406">
<p>Finally, after the youngsters were sated, she took them away.&nbsp;
Apparently our 'backyard' was only the spot that she had chosen to park them for
the day while she foraged nearby.&nbsp; She did not take them far -- just
farther into the small woods.&nbsp; If you looked for her, you could still see
her.</p>
<p>On one of the subsequent days, we took the first of several day hikes.&nbsp;
We chose to day hike instead of backpack for two reasons: first, rain and
thunderstorm were forecast for the entire weekend in this region of the country;
and second, Shenandoah National Park is reported to have a black bear population
density higher than almost anywhere else in the country: one per square
mile.&nbsp; So, day hikes it was.&nbsp; Our first target was Lewis Falls, a walk
of about 4 miles roundtrip, about half of which was on the Appalachian
Trail.&nbsp; We packed water, lunch and raingear, and headed off, using a trail
map provided by the park.</p>
<p>The walking was surprisingly easy; we got to the half way point, at a view
point called Blackrock, so quickly that we were surprised.&nbsp; Below is a
photo taken by Joya there.&nbsp; The weather in the background looks much nicer
than it was: dark clouds sprinkling rain on us were the norm for the whole hike.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/131-3136_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>We reached the falls after descending 1000 feet down a stream bed.&nbsp; They
were modest but very pretty falls -- almost delicate.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/131-3160_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>On all of our walks through Eastern woods, we would encounter millipedes
making their way across the trail.&nbsp; Often they were huge -- 6 or 8 inches
-- so large that they made noise as they moved.&nbsp; Below is one specimen, with Jody's thumb
shown to give you an idea of scale.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/131-3169a_IMG.JPG" width="457" height="703"></p>
<p>The all-uphill walk back to camp warmed us well, which we good since the
weather had turned; we now had a whipping wind and periodic rain, although not
enough that we had to put on raingear.&nbsp; Once back to camp, though, it
really came down.</p>
<p>Sunsets produced beautiful cloudscapes.&nbsp; This photo does not really do
justice to the weather scenes we encountered.&nbsp; Often, a lovely sunny moment
would be instantly replaced by near darkness and rain.&nbsp; The clouds seemed
to race across the sky. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/131-3172_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We later took another hike, this time to Dark Hollow Falls.&nbsp; This was a
bit shorter, just shy of 4 miles total.&nbsp; This walk was also easy, even though
it too included some steep descents.&nbsp; I guess any walk is easy when you are
used to carrying 50 or 60 pounds on your back while hiking.</p>
<p>Here we are at the bottom of Dark Hollow Falls, enjoying the view.&nbsp; The
ambience was very busy, though -- there were about a hundred Junior Girls Scouts
scurrying about, leaping from rock to rock, chatting, and trying to net trout
fingerlings.&nbsp; This was Sunday of Memorial Day weekend -- we expected to
have company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Photo courtesy of Joya,
obviously.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/131-3182_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>These falls were also lovely.&nbsp; I think the best part about a waterfall
is the sound.&nbsp; I just sat and listened to the water for a long time.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/131-3179_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>We were finally at our last day in the park, had not seen any bears at all,
and were quite dissappointed -- you might say it was unbearable, if you were of a
punny bent.</p>
<p>We had become friends with the campground host during our week stay.&nbsp; He
came by and took us to see 2 more wildlife offspring: a junco nest with 3 baby
birds in it, and a red shouldered hawk's nest, also with 2 babies, although
these were very large babies, already as big as a small chicken.&nbsp; This was
very fun, but really only wet our appetite -- we wanted bear.&nbsp; The host
told us to go out to a certain location and watch, as he had seen a bear
crossing this spot on several occasions.&nbsp; We waited almost an hour, until
nearly sunset, never seeing more than lots of deer.&nbsp; We determined to go
bear-hunting in our car, and did so, with limited hopes for success.&nbsp; On
the way, Joya shot this sunset photo.</p>
<p>Very close to full dark, while driving 5 miles per hour on skyline drive,
Jordan spotted her right next to the road, but hidden: a mother bear and FOUR
cubs.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; The cubs were as small as puppies, and
skibbled up a tree at the slightest disturbance.&nbsp; They spent a lot of time
skibbling up and down trees as we watched.&nbsp; Our watching signaled other
drivers to stop and look, some noisily and intrusively.&nbsp; The mama bear did
not appreciate all the commotion, and took her brood back into the woods.&nbsp;
The other cars all left.&nbsp; We figured out that she was trying to get her
family across the road, and predicted where she would try to do so again --
successfully.&nbsp; This time, whenever another car came by, we all looked the
other way (at the sunset), and no one stopped to drive her off.&nbsp;
Ironically, we may have actually been thwarting her: she finally stepped onto
the shoulder of the road and waited.&nbsp; A car came by, saw her, and stopped,
lights on, illuminating her brightly.&nbsp; This seemed to be what she was
waiting for: she then carefully and slowly crossed the road.&nbsp; A few seconds
later, the first cub shot across, and a bit later the second.&nbsp; The third
and forth crossed nearly together, but all of them were moving as fast as they
could across this exposed and well-lit surface.&nbsp; Safely across, she took
them deep into the woods on the other side.</p>
<p>Sadly, no photos of this experience show any bears.&nbsp; Most are solid
black, with perhaps a pair or two of bear eyes gleaming back -- it was simply
too dark.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/132-3232_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>However, the following day, in the location that our friend the camp host had
said, we saw this fella (at least, we called him a 'he').&nbsp;&nbsp; We
discovered him as were were leaving camp.&nbsp; We watched him for 10 minutes or
so as he ambled along parallel to the road, about 30 yards into the woods.&nbsp;
That made 6 bears total!&nbsp; We were all ecstatic.</p>
