  <p>In case you have just rejoined this narrative, we are in Annapolis to
  witness and share in the induction of Jody's nephew Kevin in the United States
  Naval Academy.&nbsp; Kevin wants to be an astronaut, and becoming a naval
  aviator is one of the best ways to fly in the U.S. space program.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>The Naval Academy is appropriately surrounded by water on 3 sides.&nbsp;
  Located in the historic town of Annapolis, it is a beautiful campus, spacious,
  with imposing granite buildings set back from tree-lined roadways.
  </p>
<p>We all took a guided tour of the campus, which began with the aquatic center,
below.&nbsp; As you may imagine, all USNA students must become expert swimmers.&nbsp;
In addition, all midshipmen must jump off the highest platform below wearing
some or all of their gear.&nbsp; Also, they have to swim 1/2 mile in all of
their gear in under 40 minutes.&nbsp; Failure to comply with these or other of
the many physical requirements is cause for ejection from The Academy -- but
they do get as many tries as they need, so it is not quite as bad as it sounds.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4249_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
<p>Below Amira and Kevin listen to our guide describe the building featured in
the following 2 photographs.&nbsp; The large glass arch you see in the
background was formerly an opening through which ships passed in order to be
loaded with ammunition.&nbsp; Now a multi-purpose room used by the students, it
used to be a waterfront armory.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4254_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
<p>The student lounge area, where students may entertain parents or guests, who are not allowed into the student's dorm rooms.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4255_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"><p>The is Bancroft Hall,
which houses all 4,000 plus midshipmen, which is the rank that all USNA students
hold until they graduate.&nbsp; This shot looks a bit odd since it is a
composite of 4 shots, giving you a nearly 180 degree view of this magnificent
building.&nbsp; For those of you with either high bandwidth or patience, you can
click on the small image below and get the full 1.5MB version, which gives you a
proper sense of how large this edifice really is.
<p><a href="images/2/142-4257mBIG_IMG.JPG"><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4257m_IMG.JPG" width="638" height="127">
</a><p>This is the Memorial Room at the rear of Bancroft Hall, where special
events are sometimes held.&nbsp; It is a meditation room of sorts (as can be
seen by the expression on Kevin's face).
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4263a_IMG.JPG" width="548" height="747">
<p>And this is the on-campus chapel.&nbsp; Midshipmen are &quot;encouraged&quot;
(whatever that means) to attend some religious service each week.&nbsp; As it
turns out, Kevin joined the church choir this summer within his first week,
partly to get away from his squad leader for a while, and partly because they
serve pizza.&nbsp; How is that for a Higher Calling?<p>Midshipmen are forbidden
from marrying while students.&nbsp; While on the tour we learned that, on the
first Saturday following graduation day (called Commissioning Day), the chapel
is booked solid all day for a series of weddings -- every 30 minutes!
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4270m_IMG.JPG" width="613" height="486">
<p>After the tour, we were allowed to shop in the Midshipman's Store (open to
friends and family only once or twice per year).&nbsp; Below we all proudly
model our purchases.<p>Joya has a T-shirt that says &quot;United States Naval
Academy&quot; in gold lettering.&nbsp; Kevin is wearing a new watch (required
gear).&nbsp; Michael's hat says USNA.&nbsp; Jordan's T-shirt says Navy and is
exactly like the P.E. T-shirts worn by Plebes (first year midshipmen --
&quot;lowest of the low&quot;).&nbsp; I am holding a bottle of sparkling grape
juice with a USNA label.&nbsp; Amira is holding a USNA T-shirt which has the
names of the entire class of 2005 on the back.&nbsp; Kenny's USNA hat has the
ever-popular &quot;BEAT ARMY&quot; expression, which we heard or say several
times a day while in Annapolis.&nbsp; For those of you from other planets or
ignorant of college sports, this refers to the legendary rivalry between the
Army and Navy.&nbsp; Since the early 1900s they have played a much-contested
football game each year.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4277a_IMG.JPG" width="546" height="467">
<p>This is one of the main historic streets in the city of Annapolis.&nbsp; Note
the brick street, gas lamps and architecture.&nbsp; This is really a quaint,
lovely little town.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/142-4279_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
<p>After the Elgans deposited their son on &quot;I-Day&quot; (induction day), we
all waited around on campus, hoping to catch a glimpse of Kevin's transformation
into a Plebe.&nbsp; We did see him through a window in one building, being
issued some sneakers and carrying a duffel bag of his gear, sporting his new
hair cut, but these pictures did not come out well.<p>Joya caught Kevin loading
his 60-pound bag of gear onto the truck on their way to the dorm room.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/143-4301_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640">
<p>We did not see him again until all 1000 plus new Plebes were inducted during
the Induction Ceremony.&nbsp; Kevin was a little shell-shocked and starving, and
we only had a half hour before he was sucked back into the vortex.&nbsp; He ate
nearly the whole time we were with him -- anything we could find to give him.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/143-4350_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640">
<p>At 1900 hours (7 PM for you landlubbers) Kevin had to say goodbye.&nbsp;
There were sad and hopeful tears all around.&nbsp; Kevin kept it together lots
better than we all did.&nbsp; His parents would not hear from him, except by
letter, for 3 weeks or so, when he is granted his first 3-minuted phone
call.&nbsp; Welcome to the Navy.
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/143-4352a_IMG.JPG" width="527" height="610">
<p>Besides the Elgans and the Thomases, 2 sets of Mulroys were also in
attendance, although we lamely failed to get a picture of them.&nbsp; Mike and
Judy Mulroy were present, up from Georgia, and Mickey and Mary Beth Mulroy and
family were down from Washington D.C.&nbsp; We all went out to dinner that night
and got a good visit in, and then headed off in our separate directions.&nbsp; <p>It
was a sobering reminder that our children were going to go away at some point,
too, and Jody and I realized that we were really not looking forward to our
turn. <p><a href="july_1_to_july_5.htm">July 1 to July 5 - Decompression</a> <p>&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>
