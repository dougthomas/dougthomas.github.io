<p>We use a campground locator to find campgrounds, as I have mentioned
before.&nbsp; The directory editors visit each campground, and rank them on a
scale of 1-10 in 3 categories: overall campground facilities offered, restroom
cleanliness, and scenery/ambiance.&nbsp; The latter measure essentially tells us
how picturesque the place is: 4 or below means it is a pit, 5 and 6 mean questionable, 7
and 8 mean OK, and 9-10 is beautiful.&nbsp; We had selected the Windy City
Campground and Beach because it was close to Chicago, and was rated 6/8/6.&nbsp;
Boy, were we disappointed.&nbsp; It was horrible -- about 30 yards from I-80
with constant screaming truck noise, no shade trees in our section of the
campground, and very small sites that were very close together.&nbsp; Also, the
'beach' was some brown sand dumped next to a pond that was full of floating
algae.&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; The truly amazing thing was that some people knew about
the condition of this park, and still chose to stay here.&nbsp; A 'family' of
weekenders immediately behind us, who had their trailer parked there for the
season, actually had a keg of beer strapped to the back of their rig.&nbsp; We
called them 'the hillbillies'.&nbsp; Another person -- informing us of the best
places for Chicago-style pizza -- proudly made margarine for a living on the night
shift.&nbsp; It was a different reality, I'll tell you.&nbsp; We tried to
imagine a life where 'camping' in such a manner would be fun and restful -- and
failed.&nbsp; We gritted our teeth, and set up shop in our new digs.</p>
<p>To get a change of scenery (and out of the traffic noise), first thing the
next day we went into Oak Park, a small suburb very near downtown Chicago.&nbsp;
Frank Lloyd Wright made Oak Park his home for years, and his house and
architectural studio were preserved there.&nbsp; Within an easy walk were
another dozen or so Wright-designed home.&nbsp; After bumbling around a bit, we
found parking, and got directions to the home and studio from a fast-food
place.&nbsp; You would think that Oak Park would insure that there were clear
signs indicating where the Wright home was located, but we found only one, and
its intent was difficult to discern.</p>
<p>We got to the home and signed up for a 4:00 PM tour, which gave us 90 minutes
or so to take a walking tour of the Wright homes in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>We found the sign below on the front of his studio.&nbsp; The logo at the
bottom right is Wright's logo.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6484b_IMG.JPG" width="353" height="568"></p>
<p>This is a shot of the studio, from the exterior on Chicago Avenue.&nbsp; Not
very striking, I know, but that is due to my poor photography, not the
design.&nbsp; Built in the late 1800s, the Wright home and studio must have
looked like alien spaceships -- everything else built at this time was
Victorian.&nbsp; Although not in the Prairie style that Wright invented, the
home and studio have Prairie elements in them.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6485a_IMG.JPG" width="556" height="418"></p>
<p>I will not give you a play-by-play photo journal of the homes we saw on our
walk -- just the high spots. </p>
<p>Still pre-prairie, but really interesting.&nbsp; Note the windows: they are
in a horizontal line, which gives an interior visitor a grand view of the
outside and nature.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6488a_IMG.JPG" width="535" height="655"></p>
<p>Also not Prairie -- this was a remodel, where Wright re-worked an existing
home.&nbsp; Note the long rectangular chimneys, and the ornate woodwork around
the windows.&nbsp; Jordan is listening to the audio guide we rented to help us
&quot;see&quot; some of the details and design elements in the houses.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6491_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>This is a detail from the house above -- this is the rear of the home.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6490a_IMG.JPG" width="551" height="507"></p>
<p>This is a 'real' Prairie style home -- low, with the lines running
horizontally, and a large fireplace and chimney in the center of the
house.&nbsp; Note again the bank of windows seen just below the roofline.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6494m_IMG.JPG" width="639" height="274"></p>
<p>I am not sure if this is Prairie style, but it is certainly quintessentially
Wright.&nbsp; He was strongly influenced by Japanese styles, very apparent in
this home.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6496a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>If you saw pictures of Fallingwater, you will see similarities here; this
house predates Fallingwater, but the horizontal pans will look familiar.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/164-6497m1_IMG.JPG" width="622" height="452"></p>
<p>One of the mainstay features of Wright's architecture was offsetting the
front entry, mostly so it was not seen from the front of the house.&nbsp; The
entry way below is visible, but offset.&nbsp;&nbsp; These homes were all built
or remodeled before 1910 and were VERY modern.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6502a_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>Note the &quot;art glass&quot; in the windows. This is another common element
in Wright homes.&nbsp; The houses he designed had huge amounts of crafted
materials made especially for each home.&nbsp; Besides the windows, homes might
have built in furniture, moldings, light fixtures, cabinets, etc. all hand
crafted, but all designed by Wright.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6501a1_IMG.JPG" width="603" height="333"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn't take a picture of a neighboring house to give a
contrast as to how different these homes were for their time.&nbsp; Wrights
studio looks like it could have been built 5 years ago.&nbsp; The prairie-style
houses reflected the flatness of the country around them, and the banks of
windows let in loads of light.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6510a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The walking tour was very nice.&nbsp; We could go at our own pace which
always works for us.&nbsp; The house/studio tour were really interesting,
too.&nbsp; In Wright's house (which he did while working for someone else and
led to his going out on his own) he designed some very cool things for his
family.&nbsp; The children's play room, for example, had a baby grand piano in
it, but the body of it hung out over the back stairway.&nbsp; From inside the
room, the piano looked like a spinet.&nbsp; The windows in his bedroom were
designed to be in the shape of a kimono.&nbsp; Actually, there were a million
unique touches.&nbsp; The guy was brilliant.&nbsp; He was also arrogant as
hell.&nbsp; As an older man he actually said something like &quot;with 15 more
years I could change the face of America&quot;, and that it had been said of him
that he was the greatest architect ever -- which he felt would not be
incorrect.&nbsp; His childhood was unique also, for a variety of reasons: his
mother, while pregnant with him, determined that he would become a great
architect.&nbsp; When he was born, she hung pictures of the great cathedrals in
the nursery to inspire him, and gave him special geometrically shaped blocks to
play with.&nbsp; This influence you can readily see in a Wright design; his
works are often composed of intricately arranged simple geometrical
shapes.&nbsp; Look again at his logo, which is only a circle and some
rectangles.</p>

<p>That evening, we visited with my cousin Dionne, who I had not seen in 20 or
more years.&nbsp; She is my maternal Grandmother's sister's youngest daughter,
and is about my age.&nbsp; She moved to the Chicago area while I was in college,
and we had missed seeing her on any of her visits out west.&nbsp; We took Dionne
and her son Zach out to dinner, where we all got caught up a bit on each other's
lives.&nbsp; It was really great to reconnect with her after all these
years.&nbsp; Sadly, we did not get a picture.&nbsp; In addition to Zach, her 14
year old youngest son, Dionne's other children are Shawn, a 19 year old student
at Wesleyan, and Jana, a 17 year old daughter.&nbsp; Dionne movingly described
her trials with Jana, who it seems is unreachable; she told Dionne that Dionne
was required by law to feed and cloth her, but that Jana was going to do
whatever she wanted in the meantime.&nbsp; Jana had already spent a year in a
substance abuse center.&nbsp; The next step for Dionne was to meet with the
District Attorney to see if she had any options.&nbsp; In the face of such
defiance, we had little to offer Dionne except our ears.&nbsp; We felt for her.</p>
<!--msthemeseparator--><p align="center"><img src="_themes/expeditn/exphorsa.gif" width="600" height="10"></p>
<p>The next day we visited the Windy City.&nbsp; We parked near Soldier Field
(the Cubs stadium, I think), right on the lake.&nbsp; Jordan really wanted to
tour the Shedd Aquarium, so that's what we started with.&nbsp; And so,
appropriately, Jordan selected, processed and laid out the pictures included in
this section, learning the basics of the program I use to create and maintain
this web site in the process.</p>
<p>Here is a view of the downtown skyline from the aquarium.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6511M_IMG.JPG" width="603" height="264"></p>
<p>Here we are at the entrance, mugging.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6569b_IMG.JPG" width="573" height="528"></p>
<p>We were impressed by this aquarium.&nbsp; Lots of fun new things to see,
including this 12 foot long anaconda.&nbsp; It was completely underwater when
this was taken.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6515_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>We don't generally care much for animal tricks, but the Beluga whales and
white-sided dolphins were amazing.&nbsp; The trainers told us that the behaviors
we were seeing were all natural to the animals; they had simply been taught to
do the behaviors on demand.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6518a_IMG.JPG" width="298" height="317"></p>
<p>This dolphin got some serious air.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6520a_IMG.JPG" width="278" height="619" align="left">
<img border="0" src="images/9/165-6521a_IMG.JPG" width="276" height="606"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6526a_IMG.JPG" width="435" height="368"></p>
<p>The grand finale.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6525a_IMG.JPG" width="603" height="536"></p>
<p>There was also a fabulous seahorse exhibit.&nbsp; Sadly, the few pictures we
have are mostly blurry, but interesting enough that we included them anyway.</p>
<p>This is a shot of a pipefish.&nbsp; Seahorses and pipefish are closely
related.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6535a_IMG.JPG" width="618" height="193"></p>
<p>Another pipefish, with coral at left.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6546a_IMG.JPG" width="651" height="530"></p>
<p>And this is a seahorse.&nbsp; The leafy 'growths' on it are not attached
plants, but are part of the seahorse.&nbsp; The seahorse's head is at the lower
right.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6541_IMG.JPG" width="625" height="470"></p>
<p>If you look carefully, you can see some tiny -- but fully grown -- seahorses
clinging to the plants at center right.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6545_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>There were also penguins.&nbsp; Many were molting, which accounts for the
fuzz you can see.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/9/165-6568_IMG.JPG" width="643" height="484"></p>
<p>After the aquarium, we took a small drive along Lakeshore Drive, towards the
North end of Chicago, after which we zig-zagged back through the city in search
of a suitable restaurant.&nbsp; I managed to get us into &quot;the
projects&quot; -- publicly supported low income housing -- in the process, which
did not make Jody very happy.&nbsp; It looked like a 3rd world country there --
right inside one of America's great cities.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; We did finally
manage to find a nice Italian spot, where we found that wine was to be had only
if you brought it with you or had some delivered -- BYOB, basically.&nbsp; Our
waiter brought over the wine list from a nearby pharmacy, which delivered until
10 PM within 4 minutes of the order.&nbsp; Also weird, although our waiter
assured us it was quite common out here.</p>
<p>On the way back to our lovely and inviting campsite, we encountered a
humongous accident that tied us up for 30 or so mintues, which Jody
photographed, below.&nbsp; See the red lights?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
