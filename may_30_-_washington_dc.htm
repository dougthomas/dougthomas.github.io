  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had visited Washington D.C. on two prior occasions as a family, but we
love it enough that we felt it warranted at least a week or so on this
pass.&nbsp; We continued driving from Harper's Ferry, and after a 2 hour delay
caused by an accident on the beltway, we arrived at Cherry Hill Park campground,
just outside the beltway on the Baltimore side.&nbsp; As this is one of the only
campgrounds serving the metropolitan D.C. area, it was pricey: $40 or so a
night.&nbsp; As the lady said who checked us in: welcome to Washington D.C..
  </p>
<p>We set up camp in a nice spot, although the whole park is so close to the
beltway that there is constant car and truck noise all day and all night.&nbsp; After a
quick dinner, we retired.
  </p>
<p>The next day we boarded a city bus bound for the nearest metro station, and
ascended up out of the bowels of the subway at the Naval Memorial, where a
precision dress drill was about to take place.&nbsp; So we parked our butts on
the cut stone steps of the monument plaza and began to eat our lunch.&nbsp; After we
had been there only a few minutes, one of the sailors approached Joya and asked
her if she got scared easily.&nbsp; She replied no.&nbsp; He then asked if she
had any special fears regarding having sharp objects very near her face, and she
again said that she did not.&nbsp; Finally he asked if she would help out with
the drill that was about to happen, and when she said she would, he told her to
come forward at his signal, and handed her a cap which she was to wear.
  </p>
<p>Now very curious, we watched the drill begin.&nbsp; It was very impressive,
involving about a dozen men, along with a color guard and some other uniformed
personnel.&nbsp; At the signal, Joya stepped forward and stood very still.&nbsp;
Rifles with bayonets whirled about, very close to her face and head.&nbsp; You
can see that she is smiling -- true to her word, she was not afraid.

at left, Jordan was doing her best to impersonate the bronze
sculpture of the sailor at right.&nbsp; Behind them both can be seen the steps
that we sat on during the drill.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 This photo is especially for Carl, Jody's
dad, who served in the Navy.&nbsp; It is set near the center of the square
comprising the Naval Memorial.</p>
<p>We toured the Navy Memorial museum, housed in one of the buildings just off
the central plaza that constitutes the memorial.&nbsp; This was interesting,
with lots of info about submariners and the hardships that they endured while at
sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After our exciting introduction to D.C., we headed for 'the mall', Washington
lingo for the large park sitting between the Lincoln memorial at one end and the
Capitol building at the other.&nbsp; Many of the monuments and historical
buildings&nbsp; are a short walk from the mall.&nbsp; We started at our favorite
of the many Smithsonian museums, the National Museum of Natural History.&nbsp;
Below, Jordan models next to the leg bones of an elephant we encountered there.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3304a_IMG.JPG" width="312" height="423"></p>
<p>And here is the elephant -- or rather, his skin and tusks, as he is now
stuffed.&nbsp; I believe he was originally killed by poachers.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3305a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After elephants, we took in one of the 4 IMAX films showing at the
museum.&nbsp; We tried for the film on the Galapagos Islands (a destination Jody
and I would like to attain some day), but it was already sold out, so we opted
for the IMAX 3-D Circque du Soliel's production of &quot;The Journey of
Man&quot;.&nbsp; We love Cirque, and highly recommend all of their shows, having
now seen a half-dozen or so.&nbsp; The Journey of Man features quite a number of
classic Cirque acts all wrapped up neatly in a simple but beautiful plot
following a boy through the passages of life.&nbsp; The visuals are stunning:
with the 3-D glasses on, everything we watched seemed to somehow be more vivid
than real life.</p>
<p>The mall is a busy place during the summer, nearly overrun with tourists
crossing from one museum to another.&nbsp; However, after 5:00 PM the locals
reclaim it for a variety of sports activities.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3309a_IMG.JPG" width="448" height="290"></p>
<p>The next day we focused on the Southeastern corner of the mall.&nbsp; We
tried to get in for a tour of the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, to see paper
money printed, but all the allotted 'tickets' for the day had already been given
out (by 9:30 AM).&nbsp; This was a recurring theme this trip, and one for which we were
unprepared: on our last two visits to our nation's capitol, we were there
during October, and essentially had the city to ourselves, tourist-wise.&nbsp;
This was a stark contrast; there were tour busses everywhere, loaded with hoards
of noisy school kids dressed in matching T-shirts and/or caps.&nbsp; We made a
note to avoid this town during the summer in the future.&nbsp; You would be well
advised to as well.</p>
<p>However, we were there, and made the best of it.&nbsp; We stood in line early
for the things we really wanted to see, and this day managed to get tickets to
the Holocaust Museum.&nbsp; Our time was not until 12:30, so we popped over to
the Jefferson Memorial first, which is right across the Potomac.&nbsp; Here is
part of the walk on the way over to the monument.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3310_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Jefferson himself would have hated his memorial.&nbsp; Although it is moving
and interesting, we discovered in <i>Lies Across America</i> that Jefferson's
words, which adorn the walls of this Greek temple, were taken out of context, and/or phrases
disparate in time and intent were joined together to portray a purer picture of this great man.&nbsp; That said, it was nonetheless a marvelous
monument to one of the intellectual giants of our land.&nbsp; In the photo
below, the words on Jefferson's right are taken from the Declaration of
Independence, a document about which he was most proud, and rightly so in my
opinion.&nbsp; The statue is about 3 times life size.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3313a_IMG.JPG" width="424" height="557"></p>
<p>As I mentioned on the page regarding Monticello, Jefferson suggested (and was
given) his own epitaph.&nbsp; Not commonly known is his 'Statute of Virginia for
Religious Freedom', which had the chief effect of eliminating the state-mandated
requirement that all persons attend church at least once per month, or face
jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jefferson often invoked God in his writings, but was
very private when it came to how he chose to worship.&nbsp; He is labeled a
Unitarian, although I do not know if this is a label he ever publicly gave
himself.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3315a_IMG.JPG" width="551" height="213"></p>
<p>We next walked over for our tour, first stopping at the excellent Museum
Cafe, which served up very tasty reasonably priced vegetarian fare.&nbsp; If you
are ever in D.C., you must not miss the Holocaust Museum -- but it is not a
pleasant experience.&nbsp; The horrors of the Holocaust are dramatically and
thoroughly documented there, on 4 floors of well-presented and organized
artifacts and multimedia displays.&nbsp; It is a grueling, brutal museum.&nbsp;
We spent nearly 6 hours there, and still did not read all of the information or
watch all of the short film segments available.</p>
<p>&quot;Lest we forget&quot;...</p>
<p>That pretty much did us in, so we returned to our home base, a 1 hour metro
and bus ride, and retired early.</p>
<p>The next day we returned to the mall, again to the National Museum of Natural
History.&nbsp; Our first stop was the Harry Winston Gem Exhibit (or some such),
which features the infamous Hope Diamond, pictured below at about life size --
it is not humongous.&nbsp; It is, however, a blue diamond, which is rare, and is
one of those artifacts about which much more fuss is made than is warranted, in
my opinion.&nbsp;
Sorry the photo is so bad, but we took it through glass, and our point-and-shoot
camera's focusing mechanism sometime gets confused when shooting through glass.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3338a_IMG.JPG" width="611" height="528"></p>
<p>There were also a zillion brilliant gems and other pieces of jewelry, the
tiara below amongst them; most of these were more impressive and beautiful than
the Hope Diamond.&nbsp; Jody learned that the piece below was donated by a
private family, but it originally contained emeralds.&nbsp; Prior to donation, they
removed them, and replaced them with cheaper turquoise.&nbsp; Go figure.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3342a_IMG.JPG" width="613" height="386"></p>
<p>After jewels, we were hungry, and had packed a nice picnic lunch for this
purpose.&nbsp; However, it was raining, so we had to 'stealth picnic', a
technique we had perfected in Williamsburg: order a drink or two at a busy
cafeteria, and then sit down at a remote table.&nbsp; Leave the drink(s) in full
view, and proceed to prepare and eat the packed lunch, as unobtrusively as
possible.&nbsp; Works great, and is much cheaper than buying lunch.</p>
<p>The afternoon of this day we finally made it over to the Southwestern end of
the mall, and started with the Korean War Memorial.&nbsp; The soldiers below are
all life sized.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3347a_IMG.JPG" width="642" height="357"></p>
<p>Not far away is the Lincoln Memorial, my personal favorite.&nbsp; If I could
meet one of the dead, I would choose him, perhaps over all others.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Something in the renderings of his face -- and thus my mental reconstruction of the man
-- speaks deeply to me.</p>
<p>Here I am reading his 2nd inaugural address, inscribed on the right-hand wall
of his monument.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3363a1_IMG.JPG" width="489" height="461"></p>
<p>And here is an unusual shot of the statue itself, and the inscription above
it.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3365a1_IMG.JPG" width="607" height="1112"></p>
<p>Continuing around to the Northeast corner of the mall, we next toured the
Vietnam Memorial.&nbsp; These 3 life-sized bronzed gentlemen begin the experience.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3368a_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="392"></p>
<p>The memorial continues along as a wall with all the dead and missing from
that terrible war listed, in order of the date of their disappearance.&nbsp;
Over the 15 or so years of the war, we lost more than 50,000 men and women.</p>
<p>By rising that day at 5:30 AM, driving downtown, and getting in line at the
visitor's center, we were able to obtain tickets to tour George W's new
digs.&nbsp; Our tour was scheduled to go off at 11:15 AM that same day.&nbsp;
Persons arriving in line after 7 or 7:30 typically did not get in at all.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3381a_IMG.JPG" width="648" height="226"></p>
<p>You can't take pictures in the White House, so we took this one
outside.&nbsp; While on the tour, Jordan was invited to walk down the (roped
off) 'red carpet' that the BMOC uses when making official entrances.&nbsp; The
Secret Serviceman on duty there introduced her as &quot;Madam Jordan Thomas, 48th President of
the United States&quot; as she paraded down the plushly carpeted corridor.&nbsp; It was very
fun, especially for Jordan -- but she thinks she does not want the job.&nbsp;
She is wise beyond her years.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3378a_IMG.JPG" width="618" height="383"></p>
<p>As I mentioned, we actually parked our car, in the summertime, in downtown
Washington D.C.&nbsp; Here is the picture to prove it -- and we did not get a
ticket.&nbsp; And yes, there were really A LOT of tour busses there; ours was
just one such.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3385a_IMG.JPG" width="630" height="309"></p>
<p>We were parked just across the street from Ford's Theatre, where Lincoln was
shot.&nbsp; We toured that theatre and the accompanying National Park Service brief
monologue on the history and events surrounding the death of our 16th
president.&nbsp; Predictably, we were underwhelmed with the NPS's spiel,
although the site itself was stirring.</p>
<p>In addition, we saw a pretty fun FBI weapons demonstration, where a
red-headed pleasant Special Agent fired each of the 3 weapons that agents get
issued.&nbsp; And one of the ladies' favorites was the National Museum of
American History, which had an excellent standing exhibit on &quot;The
Presidency&quot; with lots of items from the various First Ladies, including
some of their inaugural ball gowns.</p>
<p>One of our purposes in visiting this area was to see Jody's cousin
Mickey.&nbsp; If you are a regular reader of these chronicles, you may recall
that Mickey's wife Mary Beth and their children Grace and Walton were down in
Georgia during Master's time, visiting with the Mulroy's, who are Mickey's
parents.&nbsp; We caught up with them at a Flea Market in Georgetown, where Joya
snapped this processed picture of Grace.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/133-3394a_IMG.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Mickey and Beth consider one of the picture frames for sale -- Beth was
shopping for one, and Mickey was apparently along mostly to talk her out of it.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3402a_IMG.JPG" width="458" height="410"></p>
<p>Jordan managed to find the exact pair of glasses that I wore when I was 8
years old.&nbsp; Can't you see the family resemblance?</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3411_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>OK, now I'll really date myself.&nbsp; Below, Walton is playing with the original
&quot;Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots&quot;.&nbsp; I had one of these when I was about
Walton's age.&nbsp; God knows what they are going for now.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3414_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Mary Beth is gleeful that she found something to buy, and also that Mickey is
too busy chasing their kids around to stop her.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3420a_IMG.JPG" width="479" height="438"></p>
<p>After the Flea, we picnicked at a nearby park, and then drove over to
Arlington National Cemetery, stopping first to see the Marine Memorial, below.&nbsp; This is really
impressive.&nbsp; Each of these guys would stand 15 or 20 feet tall.&nbsp; Joya
showed me how to do some of the processing, which I applied to this image -- a
black and white that I hand-colored.&nbsp; You may recognize this scene from a
photo of the taking of Iwo Jima; that photo was the basis for this sculpture.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3428a1_IMG.JPG" width="536" height="528"></p>
<p>Next, we drove onto the Fort Meyer Army base in order to park near to
Arlington National Cemetery.&nbsp; This was interesting, as I had never legally
driven onto a military base before.</p>
<p>Among other things at this vast site is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
pictured below.&nbsp; It is guarded around-the-clock, with a changing of the
guard every 30 minutes.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3451a_IMG.JPG" width="539" height="376"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3460aIMG.JPG" align="left" width="219" height="733"> The girls were
getting a bit tired by this point, so I gave Joya a ride on my shoulders for
some of the walk.&nbsp; She weighs more than my pack did while backpacking, so I
could only do it for a short distance -- and boy, did I pay for my display of
machismo the next day; I had back muscle spasms that were scary and quite
painful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We obtained a pass to drive into the cemetery, and drove to where Jody's
cousin Phil was recently buried, to pay our respects.&nbsp; While there, we took
a rubbing of his gravestone, which Walton helped with, below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3463_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Here is Phil's gravestone, processed to black and white and then hand colored
by Joya.&nbsp; It is a beautiful shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CDR means 'Commander', and PH means 'Purple Heart'.&nbsp; Phil was a highly
decorated career Navy veteran.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3468a_IMG.JPG" width="497" height="434"></p>
<p>We returned with Mickey and Mary Beth to their home for dinner.&nbsp; Below,
Walton shows off his 'Aladdin' duds, courtesy of his grandparents, the Mulroy's.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3482b_IMG.JPG" width="593" height="624"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/134-3487a_IMG.JPG" align="left" width="310" height="627"> Not to be
outdone, Grace also modeled the Aladdin outfit, with equally spectacular
results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We traveled by subway quite a lot while in D.C., and found it an excellent
efficient system.&nbsp; However, there are some pretty shady characters on the
metro that one has to watch out for, like the guy in this photo.</p>

<p>The shots below were taken by Jody.&nbsp; We were riding in the small
semi-private subway that runs between the Capitol building and our congress
folk's office buildings.&nbsp; We stumbled upon this by accident: while stopping
by Lois Capps' office to pick up passes to the Senate and House galleries,
a&nbsp; garrulous security guard asked us where we were headed next.&nbsp; When
we told him we were going to the Capitol, he directed us to the basement of the
building we were in, so that we could catch this small open subway over to the
Capitol building.&nbsp; He casually mentioned that it might save us some time in
lines.&nbsp; We rode it over both times we visited the Capitol building, and
thought it was pretty nifty.&nbsp; In the rightmost photo, you can see a
congressperson sitting in the &quot;Members Only&quot; car.&nbsp; His face is
blotted out not to preserve his anonymity, but rather because we got a bad flash
bounce there, and he ended up glaringly bright.</p>

<p>The second time we rode this little subway over was the first day of the new
Democratic-controlled Senate, and we wanted to see some of that.&nbsp; We got a
late start that day, and did not get off the Metro until 10:00, with the Senate
scheduled to open at 11:00.&nbsp; Jody was certain we would never get in -- it
seemed to us that all the tourists in D.C. would want to be there.&nbsp; We got
off the metro and into this little subway, arriving at the Senate gallery at
about 10:30.&nbsp; The line inside was only 30 persons long or so; by 10:55, we
were seated in the rapidly filling gallery.&nbsp; Promptly at 11, we watched
raptly as Senator Byrd was sworn in as the new President Pro Tempore of the
Senate, and then watched and listened as Senators Daschle and Lott gave stirring
speeches regarding this historical changing of the majority mid-year.&nbsp;
After this, work resumed on the various education bills moving through both
houses of congress.&nbsp; In the Senate, Hillary presided over the proceedings
for a while.&nbsp; For the adults, this was all very fun and exciting.&nbsp; I
later spoke with a woman staying at our RV Park who had gotten in line <i>outside</i>
the building at 9:30 AM, and waited 3 hours to get inside.&nbsp; By using the
little subway, we missed that line.&nbsp; I mercifully avoided informing her
about that.</p>

Senate hungry but happy.&nbsp; While Jody and I prepared the picnic lunch for
this day, Joya caught up with some of her friends back home.&nbsp; She edited
this picture and added the caption, so no parental editorializing&nbsp; was done
here.</p>

<p>Just behind and to the left of the Capitol sits the Supreme Court,
below.&nbsp; The columns in the foreground are gigantic.&nbsp; The overall feel
of the exterior design is very fitting for the highest court of law in the land.</p>

<p>This highly processed photo was taken in natural light of the courtroom
itself, where my dad once sat as counsel representing some plaintiff or
defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3504a_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>Across the street from the Supremes sits the Library of Congress.&nbsp; This
is one of the most impressive pieces of American architecture I have ever seen
or heard of.&nbsp; The huge interior spaces are ornate but airy and
bright.&nbsp; The room pictured below is really nothing more than a hallway
leading to the main reading room, but its beauty is breathtaking.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3507_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>This is the main reading room, where anyone can obtain a library card,
request a book, and sit and read.&nbsp; This shot was taken from a 3rd floor
glassed-in room for tourists.&nbsp; The statues across the way are life
sized.&nbsp; Sorry about the odd flash bounce at center right, but this was the
best pic of the lot, and neither Joya nor I had the energy to hand-edit that
bounce out of this pic.&nbsp; We did mostly remove a metal post that supported
the glass panels, and that took long enough.</p>
<p>There is a lot of symbolism in this room, much of which I sadly cannot
remember.&nbsp; It is 8 sided to represent 8 virtues of the learned, like
justice, truth, and enlightenment.&nbsp; Each of these were represented by one
of the white marble statues, of which you can see 2.&nbsp; The smaller dark
bronze statues along the center of the photo are various historical learned
figures: Aristotle, Plato, and the like -- all representative of Western
Civilization and learning, reflecting the Eurocentrism of the time.</p>

<p>One more view.&nbsp; This is a must-see in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; We had
planned on coming back and getting a Library of Congress reading card, so that
we could sit down with a book in the reading room -- say, an original first
edition of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> -- and peruse.&nbsp; But we ran out of time
and energy.&nbsp; It will have to wait until our next visit.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3517_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>One of the few books actually visible at the Library of Congress (the other
120 million or so are stashed away in locked stacks which are off-limits to the
public) is this Gutenberg Bible, the only perfect condition vellum edition on
display anywhere in the world.&nbsp; Interestingly, directly across from it was
a hand-written bible of nearly the same year, also on vellum, that a monk had
taken 15 months to copy.&nbsp; They looked nearly identical.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3519_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Ever on the lookout for fun stuff to do while trudging along from one marble
building to another, the girls found that the railings at the back of the
Capitol building were good for sliding.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3521_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>On our way to Union Station, we discovered the Taft Memorial, an intimate,
delightful little brick and water garden.&nbsp; There were no plaques or such to
denote why it was placed there, or by whom, but we really enjoyed its lush
coolness.</p>

<p>Way before I met my wife, she traveled across country with her 2 best
friends, Mina and Linda, and they stopped in Washington D.C.&nbsp; It being a
very hot day, they cooled off by wading into a fountain at Union Station.&nbsp;
History repeats itself below, in the same fountain, although the day was not
quite as warm.</p>

and energetic city.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3552a1_IMG.JPG" width="525" height="372"></p>
<p>On our last day in the city, we rendezvoused with the Christianson family,
who live part-time in Santa Barbara and have a 14 year old daughter who is a
friend of Joya's.&nbsp; We met at the cafe in Union Station and lunched
together.&nbsp; It was really delightful, and Joya very much appreciated
connecting with someone from her own age group.&nbsp; She dearly misses all of
her friends, but is being a very good sport about spending this much
concentrated time with her parents and sibling.&nbsp; She recently announced
that she is considering enrolling in Santa Barbara High School when we return,
so that she can take choral singing, drama, art, photography, sports teams, and
the like, and also so that she can have some of the social benefits and
experiences of high school, like proms and dances.&nbsp; We are not opposed to
this idea, but fear we will see very little of our precious daughter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We took a walk through Georgetown that afternoon, mostly to see all the
embassies, but also to observe the architecture and ambiance of this quaint and
lively little neighborhood.&nbsp; We came to fully appreciate why this is so
desirable a place to live in Washington D.C.&nbsp;&nbsp; One does not need a car
at all here, since small shops are well interspersed among the tidy brick
houses, and there are several metro stops connecting to the rest of the city.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the Indian Embassy in the background, with a life size
bronze of Gandhi.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/1/135-3561a_IMG.JPG" width="389" height="630"></p>
<p>We really enjoyed this visit, but we were burned out on city traveling, long
metro rides, and lots of engine noise.&nbsp; So even though there was still a
lot to see, we left D.C. and headed for the peace of Lancaster County, where
many Amish have farms.</p>
