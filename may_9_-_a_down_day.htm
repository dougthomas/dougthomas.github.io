  <p>As we had had numerous adventures over the past days, we just stayed home
  and did homey little things in our PJs this morning.&nbsp; Below, the girls
  did their nails (a frequent occurrence).
  </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2284_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Jody caught up on some correspondence, while I continued reading &quot;Consilience&quot;
(highly recommended).&nbsp; That's me in the hammock in the background.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2285_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We were ready for something different, so we got on our bikes and further
investigated the island.&nbsp; We encountered a gift shop entirely devoted to
all things pirate.&nbsp; It had a Blackbeard exhibit, which was unfortunately
closed for remodeling.&nbsp; However, we did catch this image of the ghost of
Blackbeard checking on the construction progress.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/122-2287_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>This is most everyone's all time favorite picture to date.&nbsp; It was taken
by Jody, and processed by Joya.&nbsp; This is the front porch of our bike
rental/ice cream shop, which we visited daily.&nbsp; We bought ice creams, of
course (every day), but we also asked lots of questions of the various folks who
we found working behind the counter.&nbsp; We found a pleasant young man who was
very forthcoming about life on the island -- although he was not the business
owner.&nbsp; The next day, we met the owner: a woman who had spent the last 24
years on the island and was the mother of the young man we had
met earlier.&nbsp; Most people on the island worked 4 jobs, largely because
there is a labor shortage on the island, but also because it is all seasonal
work, and many people are related -- cousins, aunts and uncles abound
here.&nbsp; Unless you are a fisherman or a ferry worker (lots of residents are
one or the other), you earn all your yearly living during the 13 weeks of
summer/high season.&nbsp; Most businesses close entirely for the other 8 months,
and many of the populace travel or otherwise live their lives.</p>

<p>Blackbeard reportedly had a woman in every one of his 13 frequented ports of
call.&nbsp; Below one of his harlequins is caught on her way to a rendezvous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>See Doug and Jody Go On a Date!</p>
<p>As Jody and I had not properly celebrated our 16th wedding anniversary, we
went out to dinner -- alone.&nbsp; One of our favorite restaurants in the known
universe is the Backporch Restaurant, right on Ocracoke and within walking
distance of our campground.&nbsp; We dined like kings and queens on Sea Bass
with Smoked Tomatoes and Tomatillo Sauce, Crab Cakes with Sweet Red Pepper
Sauce, and Coconut Cream Pie.&nbsp; We talked nonstop, like we had not seen each
other in months.&nbsp; It was grand.&nbsp; Our waitress was one of the locals
who we pumped for islander information.&nbsp; In addition to waitressing, she
taught school during the day at the elementary school (68 students, K through
12).&nbsp; She was &quot;an O'Neal&quot;, one of the big families here.&nbsp;
She had been born here, but traveled often -- she said she was a wanderer.&nbsp;
She had been here for 2 years now, but was off to move to Alaska for a stint as
a teacher for a year or two.&nbsp; Our waitress, Joan O'Neal, took this shot.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/123-2310a_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The girls had stayed home, made their own dinner, and watched a DVD on the
computer.&nbsp; When we returned from dinner, they were still watching, so we
watched the last 30 minutes or so with them before retiring to the 'guest room':
we (Doug and Jody) were back to sleeping in the van.</p>
