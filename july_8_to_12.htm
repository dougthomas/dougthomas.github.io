<p>For this leg of our journey, we selected the exorbitantly priced &quot;Liberty
Harbor RV Park&quot;, which advertised views of the Statue of Liberty and
Manhattan right from the RV park.&nbsp; At $55 per night, we thought we were in
for a real treat.&nbsp; Well, the park was indeed right on the water, on the New
Jersey side.&nbsp; Apparently the park owners felt that they had to uphold the
world-renowned reputation that New Jersey has as a tourist destination and as a capitol of
petroleum refining out East.&nbsp; The place was a pit.&nbsp; Trash was
everywhere, the roads were uneven and barely paved, and it stank at times.&nbsp;
The resident family of cats -- which the kids greatly enjoyed -- barely had to
work at all to fill their owner's back porch with freshly caught rats, left as
gifts.&nbsp; Oh, and by the way, the &quot;view&quot; of the Statue of Liberty
was available to us by standing on the picnic table that we had to steal from
another campsite.
  </p>
<p>One of the 5 kittens, below left.&nbsp; The junk in the background gives you
a good idea of the quality of the campground.&nbsp; On the right is Kenny with
&quot;his&quot; kitten.&nbsp; Between the cats, frogs and horses, Kenny got
quite the animal experience with us during his stay.
  </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4677a_IMG.JPG" align="left" width="293" height="355"><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4675a_IMG.JPG" width="329" height="359">
  </p>
<p>Liberty Harbor was convenient, however, and was definitely the closest RV park to
Manhattan.&nbsp; We started by touring the New Jersey &quot;Liberty Science
Center&quot; at Liberty Park.&nbsp; As you can see from the photo below, this
was the current home of the traveling &quot;Grossology&quot; exhibit, which our
friend Donnis had highly recommended.&nbsp; So we went.&nbsp; This was a
kid-centric exhibit dealing with such vital topics as intestinal gas and how it
is made, the many useful properties of snot, and how to make boogers.&nbsp; It
really was a lot of fun.&nbsp; All of the exhibits were interactive, and we all
learned quite a bit about how the human body functions.
  </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4671_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
  </p>
<p>Below, Jordan grimaces in sympathetic pain as she extracts the humorous bone
from her electronic patient.&nbsp; This was a life-sized version of the game
&quot;Operation&quot;, if you are familiar with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4630_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Here, after wrestling with kids half her size, Jody managed to force her way
to the front of the line get a turn at
one of the top Grossology attractions. In the photo below she is gaily shooting simulated
dust particles up a gigantic nose -- she is making boogers, and apparently that is
a lot of fun.&nbsp; The kids in line looked a bit fierce to me, so I passed.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4640_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Jody snapped this as we exited the Grossology exhibit -- we were figuratively
sneezed out of the humongous nostrils you see behind us.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4670a_IMG.JPG" width="526" height="587"></p>
<p>Grossology occupied only one half of one floor; there were a total of 4
floors, so we continued our investigations.&nbsp; The next stop was a video lab,
where many illuminating entertainments were possible.&nbsp; Several of us
created small 8-frame animated sequences using foam blocks.&nbsp; Jordan and
Kenny played for quite a while in front of a blue screen, where the attached
equipment allowed them to play imaginary musical instruments or to paint by
waving their hands, which you can see below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4648_IMG.JPG" width="230" height="303" align="left"><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4646a_IMG.JPG" width="409" height="302"></p>
<p><br>
We ate lunch in the museum, with this view of the Manhattan skyline as a
backdrop.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4651a_IMG.JPG" width="635" height="243"></p>
<p>Half of one floor was dedicated to an interactive investigation of
perception.&nbsp; Below Joya, Jordan, Kenny and I are all inside a giant kaleidoscope.&nbsp;
Even though there were only 4 of us inside, the &quot;room&quot; seemed filled
with faces and motion.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4653_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Another very clever station was set up as a mini basketball shoot with
special glasses.&nbsp; The glasses distorted your view of the hoop so that it
appeared to be about 1 foot to the right of where it actually was.&nbsp; After
10 or 15 shots, your brain would compensate for this, and you could make a
basket every time.&nbsp; The fun part came when you took the glasses off and
shot.&nbsp; The first few shots missed completely, even though the basket was
only 4 or 5 feet away.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4660_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Joya trying her luck with the prismatic basketball game; that is the hoop in
the foreground.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/146-4662_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Kenny and Jody took in a 17 minute film of open heart surgery.&nbsp; There
were great exhibits on memory and perception, lots of puzzles, etc.&nbsp; We saw
an IMAX film on caving that was absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Overall we had a really fun time at the Liberty Science Center.&nbsp; Every
exhibit was interactive, so it was all very entertaining: as opposed to just
looking and reading, one 'did'.&nbsp; Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Although all of us had been to Liberty Island and Ellis Island before this
trip, Kenny and Jordan had never been up to the crown of the Statue of Liberty.
(Neither had Jody, but after trying it twice before she decided to pass.)&nbsp;
After confirming that the crown was open (although Ellis Island was closed due
to a visit by President Bush that day) and finding out we had to be on the first
ferry, we were ready.&nbsp; It took us more than 2 hours to climb the steep
stairs to the top.&nbsp; The separate staircases going up and down are
intertwined so that the stairway going down was right above our heads.&nbsp; It
was pretty tough for me since it wasn't made for people over 6 feet tall.&nbsp;
The stairway is also narrow and there aren't very many windows.&nbsp; Kenny had
a few rough moments on the way up -- he is a bit claustrophobic, and definitely
afraid of heights.&nbsp; Our progress up mostly consisted of stepping up one or
two steps and then waiting a few minutes.&nbsp; The very wide gentleman in front
of Joya was experiencing intermittent flatulence, and allowing us all to share
in it, making our passage up the winding interior staircase inside the statue
itself even more interesting. </p>
<p>You can see from the photo below how excited Kenny was to be beginning the
narrow and steep ascent up the spiral staircase. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4723_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>The reason it takes so long to get to the crown is that the space at the top
is not much bigger than a small bathroom.&nbsp; And on top of the size, of
course, everyone wants their picture taken.&nbsp; The temperature was pretty
nice until we got to the top, where it was about 100� and the solid copper
walls were hot to the touch.&nbsp; Well, that is one way to keep people moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4730_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>It took us about 15 minutes to get down.&nbsp; The only thing left was to get
the silly foam crowns that were <i>de rigueur</i>.&nbsp; Jordan was SO happy to
have finally made it.&nbsp; It was her third time to the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4733a_IMG.JPG" width="596" height="598"></p>
<p>Ah, the hats.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4741_IMG.JPG" width="595" height="455"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4736_IMG.JPG" width="281" height="374" align="left"><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4762_IMG.JPG" width="279" height="375" align="left"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While waiting for the ferry, Kenny called home to find who was picking him up
at the airport the next day.&nbsp; He got the news that he and his dad were going
on a belated birthday trip to a surprise destination.&nbsp; Will the fun never
cease?</p>

<p>This was taken on the return ferry.&nbsp; We successfully got Kenny to the
airport on time.&nbsp; He was flying first class (gotta love those frequent
flyer miles) so we got use of the &quot;Admiral's Club&quot;.&nbsp; Doug tried,
in vain, to do some work on the web site and send some pictures.&nbsp; The phone
company in New York is odious, just ask Doug sometime if you want the full dress
down.&nbsp; The girls spent some time on the computers in the club and the kids
had complementary snacks and drinks.&nbsp; So the time spent was nice, just
frustrating for Doug.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4771a_IMG.JPG" width="576" height="714"></p>
<p>We had one more day in New York before heading out.&nbsp; We hopped on the
water taxi which took us right to the financial district, near the twin
towers.&nbsp; The girls wanted to see a Broadway show -- the &quot;Full
Monty&quot;.&nbsp; We stood on line to get discounted tickets, but we discovered
that same day matinee tickets weren't sold there.&nbsp; Doug called the Eugene
O'Neill Theater for tickets.&nbsp; We got good seats and the show started at
2:00 PM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4778_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Jordan, Joya and Doug wanted to go up to the top of the world, which is the
southernmost twin tower.&nbsp; But they are charging $13.00 now to go up, so
they passed.&nbsp; The twin towers are a quarter of a mile high.&nbsp; This was
taken from the plaza right below them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4780_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>We found a nice deli to eat lunch.&nbsp; The tables were upstairs and the
girls got the window seat with a great view of the Avenue below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4785a_IMG.JPG" width="672" height="454"></p>
<p>These pictures of the outside of the theater were all we could get.&nbsp;
Jody tried to take a picture of us sitting in our seats, but was roundly
chastised by an officious usher, who clearly took his job way too
seriously.&nbsp; The theater was gorgeous inside and our seats were good.&nbsp;
The Full Monty was outrageously funny.&nbsp; The Broadway version had been
transplanted from Britian to America -- Buffalo, New York -- and made into a
musical.&nbsp; It sounds like a horrible idea, but it worked marvelously.&nbsp;
The humor was lowbrow and very male and very good.&nbsp; What a blast!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4786a_IMG.JPG" align="left" width="211" height="568">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/3/147-4787_IMG.JPG" width="435" height="572"></p>
<p>We did some shopping on Seventh Avenue after the performance.&nbsp; Jordan
was still on her quest for the perfect sneakers.&nbsp; We did find them, too --
but she ended up not wanting them, and opting for another pair, fortunately also
on sale.&nbsp; After shopping, we located the Zen Palate, recommended to us by
Michael and Amira.&nbsp; It was really tasty.&nbsp; The Zen Palate does fusion
food -- all types of vegetarian food with a Asian flair.&nbsp; We had a lovely
al fresco meal and people watched.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4800a_IMG.JPG" width="672" height="130"></p>
<p>We opted to eat from their more casual Lunch menu.&nbsp; Saved money
and got to eat outside.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4798a_IMG.JPG" width="668" height="314"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/147-4794a_IMG.JPG" width="637" height="625"></p>
<p>We walked back to the Financial District from the midtown Theater District --
quite the hike -- stopping along the way to shop a bit for provisions.&nbsp; We
stopped in at the Manhattan Whole Foods and bought some organic tomatoes, and at
a French Bakery and bought bread and pastries.&nbsp; And then we walked --
through Times Square, Chelsea, Greenwich Village, SoHo, TriBeCa and back to the
Financial District, to the ferry dock.&nbsp; The girls rewarded themselves (and
their tired feet) with an �clair and a baklava.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4801a_IMG.JPG" width="595" height="424"></p>
<p>With Manhattan in the background, Jordan declared it a perfect day.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4806a_IMG.jpg" width="608" height="704"></p>
<p>Our parting view of the Big Apple.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4807_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The next day, we left the Liberty Harbor Camping Pit and drove to West
Orange, New Jersey, which has the home and laboratory of Thomas Edison.&nbsp;
For you faithful readers, you will remember we went to Edison's summer home in
Fort Myers, Florida.&nbsp; The West Orange lab was unbelievable.&nbsp; The car,
below, was the first electric car.&nbsp; Edison modified a gasoline powered car
to run on batteries.&nbsp; But, alas, gasoline powered cars were faster and
cheaper, and you know the rest of that story. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4808_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>This picture is for us, really, since you can't really see what you're
looking at.&nbsp; Edison had a three story office/library built with his
lifetime achievements displayed.&nbsp; There were signed photographs of five
presidents, gifts from industries and countries, examples of many of Edison's
inventions, etc.&nbsp; There was also a bed, because Edison worked such long
hours, he would often nap during the day for short periods.&nbsp; He was in this
office much, much more than he was ever at home.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4811_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>This is a movie projector which Edison invented -- he helped create the
entire motion picture industry.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4813a_IMG.JPG" width="564" height="643"></p>
<p>This is one of the workshops on the Edison compound.&nbsp; In this workshop
were all sorts of things that might be used in experiments; animal parts,
plants, minerals, tools, etc.&nbsp; Edison prided himself on the completeness of
his facility.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4814_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>This is the machine shop, run on electricity, of course.&nbsp; It is Doug's
fantasy garage.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4815_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>This is the Edison's home.&nbsp; He wasn't a good parent nor did he spend
much time with his wife, but he did have an brilliant and industrious mind, and lots of
energy.&nbsp; An interesting man. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/3/148-4816_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Now it is North and East again, this time to Connecticut...</p>
