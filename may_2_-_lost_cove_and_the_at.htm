</blockquote>
<p>The first order of business was to establish our route of travel back out, as
this was to be our last day in the backcountry.&nbsp; We had enough food for
another full day if necessary, and indeed we had thought we would stay one more
day at Eagle Creek, but the rain the prior day had spooked us, so we packed up
in preparation for the 6.8 mile walk out.&nbsp; Below I am puzzling over the
topo map, as the trail signs and the map did not line up properly.&nbsp; After
some discussion, Jody and I talked Jordan into some additional mileage so that
we could hike up a side trail to the Appalachian Trail (AT), and then take the
AT south to Fontana Dam, near our destination back at the marina where we had
taken the boat shuttle.
  </p>
<p>We started off in what looked like the right direction, following the path
you seen in the picture below.&nbsp; This turned out to be a dangerous, unmarked
trail to the lake.&nbsp; We turned back and decided to skip the AT section, only
to find the proper trail markers a half mile from the first set.&nbsp; So, we
again set off, this time confident that we were headed on the right trail -- the
Lost Cove trail.&nbsp; By examining the topo it was clear that this hike
followed a small brook for a mile or so, and then headed straight across the
gridlines of the topo, which means it goes right up the mountain.&nbsp; Looking
at the numbers, it was over 2400 feet of elevation gain in 2 miles.&nbsp; Jody
said she was up for it, so up we went, with Jordan saying she was game but
worried about it.
  </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2112_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Well, it just about killed us.&nbsp; It took us over 2 hours to climb those 2
miles to the AT, and when we got there we were exhausted, with miles of trail to
go.&nbsp; Jody speaking here: I am estimating the angle of climb at somewhere
between 35 and 45 degrees. We were only following horse tracks and I definitely
felt like a pack mule.&nbsp; At one point, I am ashamed to say, I broke down in
tears and really felt like I would have to leave my backpack in order to make
the climb.&nbsp; The thing about climbing mountains is that it is always
deceptive.&nbsp; It is impossible to see the summit and every time you think the
top is at the next rise, there is more mountain.&nbsp; Climbing up this steeply
served to make our calves unbelievably sore for the next 3 or 4 days.&nbsp; Doug
told me later he thought my pack weighed about 40 to 45 pounds, which had I
known I would definitely have thrown stuff over the side.&nbsp; Prior to getting to the top, we lunched on our apples and granola
bars, which helped to restore us a bit.&nbsp; Below, you can see how excited
Jordan was to be on the AT.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2114_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>I again used the camera timer to capture the image below.&nbsp; We look
deceptively like real hikers, don't we?</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2115a_IMG.JPG" width="528" height="612"></p>
<p>This was one of the views we had once at the top.&nbsp; For the most part,
the AT runs along the highest ridges in the Smokes, affording breath-taking
views.&nbsp; You can readily see from the picture why these are called the
Smokies.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2117_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Once at the summit of this segment of the trail, we found a small side trail
that went up to a fire lookout tower.&nbsp; We left our packs on the AT and
walked up (even voluntarily). This was not Jody's cup of tea, but
Jordan and I climbed the ladder to the top, and I took the 8-frame composite panorama
shot below.&nbsp; This covers about 300 degrees of view from the tower.&nbsp;
The image you are looking at is one tenth size of the original.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2118_MRG.JPG" width="647" height="90"></p>
<p>Here we are descending from the tower.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2129_IMG.JPG" width="480" height="640"></p>
<p>As we neared the Fontana Dam, at about the 8 mile mark for the day, we
encountered this sign greeting AT hikers headed North.&nbsp; We thought that at
this point we had less than a mile to go.&nbsp; Wrong.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2131_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>We walked across the Fontana Dam, and looked down upon the campground which
we had stayed at in Fontana Village 4 nights before, and where we would camp
that night.&nbsp; Fontana Dam is pretty damn high, indeed (sorry, I could not
resist).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/121-2132_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Shortly past the dam on the AT was the fabled &quot;Fontana Hilton&quot;, the
nicest of the AT trail shelters.&nbsp; We wanted to see what one looked like,
after reading so much about them in the Bryson book, so we stopped by, gave it a
look over, and chatted with its sole occupant, a man who was southbound
section-hiking the AT.&nbsp; We heard from him that he had recently crossed a
family of 7 who were thru-hiking the AT.&nbsp; Thru-hiking means that they
are walking the entire 2100+ miles of the AT, from Georgia to Maine, in one long
hike (reprovisioned about weekly, of course).&nbsp; This was astonishing to
us.&nbsp; Jody and I had talked about thru-hiking the AT one day, without the
girls, since it usually takes about 4 months.&nbsp; The logistics of handling a
hike of that size for 7 people was daunting.&nbsp; The man further told us that
they were lugging a single 7-person tent along with them.&nbsp; Our 3 or 4
person tent weights nearly 9 pounds, an amount I had qualms about at the time of
purchase.&nbsp; I cannot image how much theirs much weigh, although they almost
certainly split up the weight amongst themselves while hiking.</p>
<p>Our trail guidebook was a bit vague about the last leg of our trip, from the
Fontana Dam to the marina.&nbsp; We assumed we had some small number of yards to
go.&nbsp; The book said to follow the AT until it crossed a road leading to the
marina.&nbsp; It turned out to be over a mile, with six or more small hills to
traverse thrown in for good measure.&nbsp; It was nearly full dark when we
emerged from the woods within a matter of feet of where we had parked the rig at
the marina; the AT went right through the marina in fact, and we had failed to
notice that fact when we departed.&nbsp; The days total mileage was over 10, in
full pack; more than 7 hours of straight walking with 50 pounds on our
backs.&nbsp; As soon as we got to the trailer, it began to rain.&nbsp; Amazing
timing.&nbsp; We quickly stowed our gear, drank a celebratory virgin pina
colada, and drove off to find our campsite.</p>
<p>That nights dinner was a simple pasta, with a huge green salad, and several
very cold beers.</p>
