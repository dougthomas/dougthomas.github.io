<p>We stopped by the Gettysburg visitor's center in the morning of this day, to
see what insights it might offered into the cataclysmic battle that had raged
there.&nbsp; We stayed only an hour or so.&nbsp; Again, this was a National Park
Service shindig, and it was not done well.&nbsp; However, we did like the town
of Gettysburg itself.&nbsp; It has a very nice, old-world feel.&nbsp; We drove
and walked around a bit, and then headed back to camp to pack up and continue
West.</p>
<p>On our way out, we actually got a little lost, for only the second time on
the entire 10,000 miles of this trip to date.&nbsp; We were heading for
Southwestern Pennsylvania, to see Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural
masterpiece, Fallingwater.</p>
<p>The drive across the Southern Allegheny mountains went well for a while,
until around the time we hit some serious thunderstorms that tried to drown
us.&nbsp; The water was really no problem, but the car started making an odd
noise, and a bad smell of something burning came from the engine.&nbsp; All the
gauges checked out OK, and I could not see anything visibly wrong, so we looked
for and found the nearest state park we could find, in order to get the trailer
parked before we became stranded.&nbsp; We landed at Kooser, about 1 hour from
Fallingwater.</p>
<p>The next day I found a Chevy dealership about 15 miles from camp, in the
hamlet of Berlin.&nbsp; I had suspected that we had a pulley bearing on its way
out, and I was close.&nbsp; The dealer found that it was the air conditioner
compressor (running off of the same belt as the pulley I had suspected), which
was frozen solid and needed replacing.&nbsp; Of course, none were in stock, but
one could be delivered via UPS the next day.&nbsp; So I had some other odds and
ends repaired, and then I brought it back the next day for the compressor
installation.&nbsp; For this trip, Joya accompanied me, for which I was
grateful.&nbsp; While we waited, I read and she worked on her math.&nbsp; After
5 hours they told us they were done, and we settled up.&nbsp; The compressor was
covered by our extended warranty, thank god ($800 parts and labor total, all
paid by the warranty).&nbsp; However, right after we drove off the lot, at 6:30
PM, Joya discovered that most of the dash electrical components were dead,
including the radio, interior lights, etc.&nbsp; We went back, but all the
mechanics had gone home for the day.&nbsp; So, yet another trip to the dealer
was needed, this time to fix something that was not broken when we had brought
the car in.&nbsp; Arrrrrgh.</p>
<p>We had several wondrous happenings this day.&nbsp; The first occurred late
morning.&nbsp; It was pretty warm outside -- almost hot.&nbsp; Suddenly a storm
blew in and began dumping substantial quantities of water upon us.&nbsp; This
campground has no showers, so we took advantage of the one falling from the sky:
all 4 of us stripped down to underclothes and went and capered about in the
rain.&nbsp; I even soaped down a bit first, and got enough rinse afterward to
make it count as a real shower.&nbsp; It was grand.</p>
<p>The next happening was in early evening.&nbsp; We were sitting around our
campfire (usually OK in most state parks) and just gazing about during the early
twilight time.&nbsp; There was a small clearing near our campground in which
numerous fireflies could be seen performing their odd, blinking dance.&nbsp; It
was magical.</p>
<p>During all of the fun that I was having sitting around in the Chevy dealer's
waiting room for 2 days watching the paint dry and admiring the lovely 70s
decor, Jody and Jordan had some small adventures of their own back at the
trailer.&nbsp; Mostly they just hung out, read, caught up on email, napped and
the like, including hiking up to the small lake here at Kooser.&nbsp; This is
really a lovely little park.&nbsp; It is very wooded, and we have it nearly
entirely to ourselves.&nbsp; However, it has no showers, and only pit toilets,
so we are nearly 'dry camping' (with no hookups).&nbsp; As you may note from the
change of tense, I have also caught up to real-time on this travelogue, which
our semi-stranding here has allowed. </p>
<p>During our stay at Kooser, we made time for some badly-needed personal
grooming; remember, Kooser had no showers, and we had no hookups and were 'dry
camping'. </p>
<p>We all washed our hair outdoors, using wash tubs. </p>

<p>I also got a haircut and shave from Jody and Joya, respectively. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/2/137-3716a_IMG.JPG" width="516" height="345"> </p>
<p>Many of our late afternoons and early evenings were spent playing cards --
mostly Hearts, but also other 3 and 4 person games, likes Jacks. </p>
