<p>We departed late from our Montreal campground.&nbsp; We were especially lazy
since we had only 80 or so miles to travel.&nbsp; However, thunderstorms were
threatening all day, so we did manage to depart by 11:30 or so, heading
Southwest, bound for the U.S. of A.&nbsp; But this was not to be an easy
drive.&nbsp; Barely underway, we got yet another flat tire on the trailer-- on a
freeway as well, of course.&nbsp; I knew the drill pretty well by this time, so
we pulled over to a wide spot, and I began the unpleasant task of changing the
tire.&nbsp; It took 90 minutes.&nbsp; The extra time was due to the fact that
the day was so hot that the jack kept sinking into the soft asphalt,
necessitating several different tries at getting the trailer up high enough to
get the spare in place.&nbsp; I finally managed it, but I was drenched in sweat
and filthy from laying and sitting on the ground.</p>
<p>Even more fun: when I got back behind the wheel, the car would not start -- I
had left the lights on, and drained the battery.&nbsp; So we now had 6 good
tires in place, but could not move, since we needed a jump start.&nbsp; Jody
called AAA, and spoke to 2 separate rude and unhelpful representatives.&nbsp;
How do people like that get work answering the telephones where distressed
motorists are calling for help, often in difficult and uncomfortable
circumstances?&nbsp; It really does boggle the mind.&nbsp; After quite a time on
the phone and some pleading, we were assured that a tow truck was on it
way.&nbsp; The driver called a few minutes later to confirm our location, and
then informed us that it was illegal in Canada for him to give us a jump start while we
were parked on the shoulder of a freeway; he would have to tow us off the
freeway and then jump-start the van.&nbsp; The losers at AAA -- also in Toronto
-- had forgotten to
tell us that, somehow.&nbsp; Apparently they must get some kind of special
training to be both rude and uninformative.</p>
<p>The tow truck driver arrived,
and we discussed the situation.&nbsp; He indicated that another driver was on
his way who might be able to help us out.&nbsp; Almost immediately the second
truck pulled up and parked in front of the van.&nbsp; He then connected some
very long jumper cables to his truck and gave me the high sign to start
it.&nbsp; The van started right up and ran well immediately.&nbsp; I asked about
signing paperwork, and they both said &quot;not necessary -- forget about
it&quot;.&nbsp; They had illegally given me a jump start, and so they were not
going to get paid for it.&nbsp; Their promptness and helpfulness more than made
up for our shabby treatment by AAA.&nbsp; We were on our way, finally, after two and a
half hours parked in a small &quot;Y&quot; between 2 freeway branches, with
trucks whizzing by and rocking the rig on both sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It took only a couple of hours to complete the trip.&nbsp; We had
selected a KOA that was a bit pricey but was located where we could get to Model
City easily to pick up our mail, as well as the falls and the Buffalo
airport.&nbsp; It did have a pool, which we all made use of almost immediately. </p>
