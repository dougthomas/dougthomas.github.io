<p>We took a day trip up to Lexington and Concord, the location of &quot;the
shot heard 'round the world&quot; and often cited as the beginning of the
Revolutionary War.&nbsp; Near the several historic sites there stood
Louisa May Alcott's family home.&nbsp; By this time, we were all getting a bit
overfull with American history.&nbsp; So we skipped the revolutionary stuff
entirely, and
just went for a tour of the Alcott home.</p>
<p>The laides in my family were intimately familiar with some of Ms. Alcott's
work, most notably &quot;Little Women&quot;, a very autobiographical novel
recounting Ms. Alcott's growing up in this home with her several sisters.&nbsp;
The home is almost entirely original, including some fanciful pencil drawings of
fairies and unicorns done by Louisa's sister that decorate her window and door
trim.</p>
<p>Below is a shot of Louisa's fathers school, where classes and discussions
took place weekly, often featuring the ideas and/or personages of Emerson and
Thoreau, who were friends and neighbors of the Alcott family.&nbsp; Walden Pond
still sits just a few miles from the Alcott home, in Concord.</p>
<img border="0" src="images/5/151-5133_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480">
<p>Of course, no interior pictures were allowed, so you'll have to be content
with this shot of the outside.&nbsp; It does not look like much, but it really
was quite a wonderful home, full of the unusual ideas and energy of this
creative family.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that Louisa was still fairly
young and living at home when &quot;Little Women&quot; was published.&nbsp; It
was an immediate bestseller, and earned Ms. Alcott quite a lot of money and
fame.&nbsp; She became the principle bread winner of the family, and channeled
much of her earnings into home improvement projects.&nbsp; She never did marry,
preferring the freedom that being a wealthy single woman allowed.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/5/151-5134_IMG.JPG" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>After our sojourn in Concord, we drove Southeast in to Boston.&nbsp; We were
somewhat dreading this trip because we had heard that &quot;The Big Dig&quot;
had turned already crowded Boston into a nightmare driving experience.&nbsp; The
Big Dig is a now 10 year old road and subway improvement project that has
spiraled way out of control.&nbsp; It is years late, and billions over
budget.&nbsp; Current estimates are that it will end up costing over 14 billion
dollars to finish.&nbsp; To put this into some perspective,
normal freeways in California cost about $2 million per mile; so the Bostonians
should be getting the equivalent of 7,000 miles of freeway, right?&nbsp; The
project spans just a dozen or so miles, but does involve lots of digging.&nbsp;
And of course, during the construction, traffic is rerouted through convenient
detours like Martha's Vineyard and Chicago.&nbsp; At any rate, it is a mess, and
everyone agrees it is.&nbsp; We certainly did, but managed to arrive and get
parked anyway.&nbsp; Here, Jordan reenacts a song from one of the many musical
plays with which she is familiar as we stroll along Boston's famous &quot;North
End&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North End is the Italian section of Boston, and
we love all things Italian.&nbsp; In fact, this was the only part of Boston we
were planning on visiting, having 'done' Boston on a previous trip out East 8
years or so ago.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/5/151-5135_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>As full as we were with Revolutionary history, we did walk much of&nbsp; the
&quot;Freedom Trail&quot; -- a walking tour through Boston stopping by at many
of the historic sites.&nbsp; We even went to Fanneuil Hall just in time to catch
a 6-minute talk encapsulating the importance and history of that building.&nbsp;
Owned by the city of Boston and established as a meeting hall, it is still in
use for that purpose.&nbsp; The shot below is a detail of the clock and eagle
over the doors.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/5/151-5141_IMG.JPG" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/5/151-5142a_IMG.JPG" align="left" width="268" height="674"><br>
&nbsp;As we continued our stroll, I spied the signpost at left and thought it
interesting enough to snap a picture.&nbsp; As I was doing so, I heard someone
yelling to me from the vicinity of the bottom of the sign, saying &quot;Hey,
buddy!&nbsp; Over here!&nbsp; Hey!&quot;.&nbsp; When I looked down, he pointed
to himself and his daughter, and they mugged for a picture.&nbsp; So I obliged
them, and below is the shot.&nbsp; Sorry, but I don't know their names or
anything else about them; it was just a &quot;Boston moment&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/5/151-5143_IMG.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our only real agenda this day was to find the pizza and deli shop we had
eaten at 8 years before, and relish his pizza topped with pasta one more
time.&nbsp; This was hands down the most amazing pizza we had ever had.&nbsp; We
even sent the owner back a postcard when we got back home.</p>
<p>We did find Trio's, but it was closed, this being Sunday.&nbsp; We were very disappointed,
but we were able to rally and continue on.&nbsp; We did get this shot of the
sign to remind us.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/5/151-5144_IMG.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p>As we walked back in the general direction of our car, we came upon
this&nbsp; lively old <i>I</i>talian accordion player, and were captivated by
his energy and music.&nbsp; We paused and listened for a few minutes, shot this
picture and put $2 in his accordion case.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/5/151-5146a_IMG.JPG" width="561" height="1089"></p>
<p>We considered finding an alternate Italian food source -- the North End has
some of the best Italian food to be had anywhere -- but decided instead to make
our own Italian meal back at camp, which is what we did.</p>
